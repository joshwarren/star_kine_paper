abstract = {We present a generalization of surface photometry to the higher-order moments of the line-of-sight velocity distribution of galaxies observed with integral-field spectrographs. The gener-alization follows the approach of surface photometry by determining the best-fitting ellipses along which the profiles of the moments can be extracted and analysed by means of harmonic expansion. The assumption for the odd moments (e.g. mean velocity) is that the profile along an ellipse satisfies a simple cosine law. The assumption for the even moments (e.g. veloc-ity dispersion) is that the profile is constant, as it is used in surface photometry. We test the method on a number of model maps and discuss the meaning of the resulting harmonic terms. We apply the method to the kinematic moments of an axisymmetric model elliptical galaxy and probe the influence of noise on the harmonic terms. We also apply the method to SAURON observations of NGC 2549, NGC 2974, NGC 4459 and NGC 4473 where we detect multiple co-and counter-rotating (NGC 2549 and NGC 4473, respectively) components. We find that velocity profiles extracted along ellipses of early-type galaxies are well represented by the simple cosine law (with 2 per cent accuracy), while possible deviations are carried in the fifth harmonic term which is sensitive to the existence of multiple kinematic components, and has some analogy to the shape parameter of photometry. We compare the properties of the kine-matic and photometric ellipses and find that they are often very similar, but a study on a larger sample is necessary. Finally, we offer a characterization of the main velocity structures based only on the kinemetric parameters which can be used to quantify the features in velocity maps.},

abstract = {I start by providing an updated summary of the penalized pixel-fitting (pPXF) method, which is used to extract the stellar and gas kinematics, as well as the stellar population of galaxies, via full spectrum fitting. I then focus on the problem of extracting the kinematic when the velocity dispersion {\$}\backslashsigma{\$} is smaller than the velocity sampling {\$}\backslashDelta V{\$}, which is generally, by design, close to the instrumental dispersion {\$}\backslashsigma{\_}{\{}\backslashrm inst{\}}{\$}. The standard approach consists of convolving templates with a discretized kernel, while fitting for its parameters. This is obviously very inaccurate when {\$}\backslashsigma{\textless}\backslashDelta V/2{\$}, due to undersampling. Oversampling can prevent this, but it has drawbacks. Here I present a more accurate and efficient alternative. It avoids the evaluation of the under-sampled kernel, and instead directly computes its well-sampled analytic Fourier transform, for use with the convolution theorem. A simple analytic transform exists when the kernel is described by the popular Gauss-Hermite parametrization (which includes the Gaussian as special case) for the line-of-sight velocity distribution. I describe how this idea was implemented in a significant upgrade to the publicly available pPXF software. The key advantage of the new approach is that it provides accurate velocities regardless of {\$}\backslashsigma{\$}. This is important e.g. for spectroscopic surveys targeting galaxies with {\$}\backslashsigma\backslashll\backslashsigma{\_}{\{}\backslashrm inst{\}}{\$}, for galaxy redshift determinations, or for measuring line-of-sight velocities of individual stars. The proposed method could also be used to fix Gaussian convolution algorithms used in today's popular software packages.},

abstract = {We present new observational results that conclude that the nearby radio galaxy B2 0722+30 is one of the very few known disc galaxies in the low-redshift Universe that host a classical double-lobed radio source. In this paper, we use HI observations, deep optical imaging, stellar population synthesis modelling and emission-line diagnostics to study the host galaxy, classify the active galactic nucleus (AGN) and investigate environmental properties under which a radio-loud AGN can occur in this system. Typical for spiral galaxies, B2 0722+30 has a regularly rotating gaseous disc throughout which star formation occurs. Dust heating by the ongoing star formation is likely responsible for the high infrared luminosity of the system. The optical emission-line properties of the central region identify a Low Ionization Nuclear Emission-line Region (LINER)-type nucleus with a relatively low [OIII] luminosity, in particular when compared with the total power of the Fanaroff {\&} Riley type-I radio source that is present in this system. This classifies B2 0722+30 as a classical radio galaxy rather than a typical Seyfert galaxy. The environment of B2 0722+30 is extremely HI-rich, with several nearby interacting galaxies. We argue that a gas-rich interaction involving B2 0722+30 is a likely cause for the triggering of the radio AGN and/or the fact that the radio source managed to escape the optical boundaries of the host galaxy.},

abstract = {Most massive galaxies show emission lines that can be characterized as LINERs. To what extent this emission is related to AGNs or to stellar processes is still an open question. In this paper, we analysed a sample of such galaxies to study the central region in terms of nuclear and circumnuclear emission lines, as well as the stellar component properties. For this reason, we selected 10 massive ({\$}\backslashsigma{\$} {\textgreater} 200 km/s) nearby (d {\textless} 31 Mpc) galaxies and observed them with the IFU/GMOS (integral field unit/Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph) spectrograph on the Gemini South Telescope. The data were analysed with principal component analysis (PCA) Tomography to assess the main properties of the objects. Two spectral regions were analysed: a yellow region (5100-5800 A), adequate to show the properties of the stellar component, and a red region (6250-6800 A), adequate to analyse the gaseous component. We found that all objects previously known to present emission lines have a central AGN-type emitting source. They also show gaseous and stellar kinematics typical of discs. Such discs may be co-aligned (NGC 1380 and ESO 208 G-21), in counter-rotation (IC 1459 and NGC 7097) or misaligned (IC 5181 and NGC 4546). We also found one object with a gaseous disc but no stellar disc (NGC 2663), one with a stellar disc but no gaseous disc (NGC 1404), one with neither stellar nor gaseous disc (NGC 1399) and one with probably ionization cones (NGC 3136). PCA Tomography is an efficient method for detecting both the central AGN and gaseous and stellar discs. In the two cases (NGC 1399 and NGC 1404) in which no lines were previously reported, we found no evidence of either nuclear or circumnuclear emission, using PCA Tomography only.},

abstract = {[Abridged]. We present SEDs for single-age, single-metallicity stellar populations (SSPs) covering the optical range at resolution 2.3A (FWHM). These SEDs constitute our base models, as they combine scaled-solar isochrones with MILES empirical stellar library, which follows the chemical evolution pattern of the solar neighbourhood. The models rely as much as possible on empirical ingredients, not just on the stellar spectra, but also on extensive photometric libraries. The unprecedented stellar parameter coverage of MILES allowed us to safely extend our optical SSP SED predictions from intermediate- to very-old age regimes, and the metallicity coverage of the SSPs from super-solar to [M/H]=-2.3. SSPs with such low metallicities are particularly useful for globular cluster studies. Observed spectra can be studied by means of full spectrum fitting or line-strengths. For the latter we propose a new Line Index System (LIS) to avoid the intrinsic uncertainties associated with the popular Lick/IDS system and provide more appropriate, uniform, spectral resolution. Apart from constant resolution as function of wavelength the system is also based on flux-calibrated spectra. Data can be analyzed at three different resolutions: 5A, 8.4A and 14A (FWHM), which are appropriate for studying globular cluster, low and intermediate-mass galaxies, and massive galaxies, respectively. Polynomials to transform current Lick/IDS line index measurements to the new system are provided. A web-page with a suite of on-line tools to facilitate the handling and transformation of the spectra is available at http://miles.iac.es.},

@article{Prandoni2010,
abstract = {Context. It has recently been proposed that the jets of low-luminosity radio galaxies are powered by direct accretion of the hot phase of the IGM onto the central black hole. Cold gas remains a plausible alternative fuel supply, however. The most compelling evidence that cold gas plays a role in fueling radio galaxies is that dust is detected more commonly and/or in larger quantities in (elliptical) radio galaxies compared with radio-quiet elliptical galaxies. On the other hand, only small numbers of radio galaxies have yet been detected in CO (and even fewer imaged), and whether or not all radio galaxies have enough cold gas to fuel their jets remains an open question. If so, then the dynamics of the cold gas in the nuclei of radio galaxies may provide important clues to the fuelling mechanism. Aims: The only instrument capable of imaging the molecular component on scales relevant to the accretion process is ALMA, but very little is yet known about CO in southern radio galaxies. Our aim is to measure the CO content in a complete volume-limited sample of southern radio galaxies, in order to create a well-defined list of nearby targets to be imaged in the near future with ALMA. Methods: APEX [This publication is based on data acquired with the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX). APEX is a collaboration between the Max-Planck-Institut fur Radioastronomie, the European Southern Observatory, and the Onsala Space Observatory.] has recently been equipped with a receiver (APEX-1) able to observe the 230 GHz waveband. This allows us to search for CO(2-1) line emission in our target galaxies. Results: Here we present the results for our first three southern targets, proposed for APEX-1 spectroscopy during science verification: NGC 3557, IC 4296 and NGC 1399. The experiment was successful with two targets detected, and possible indications for a double-horned CO line profile, consistent with ordered rotation. These early results are encouraging, demonstrating that APEX can efficiently detect CO in nearby radio galaxies. We therefore plan to use APEX to obtain CO spectroscopy for all our southern targets.},

abstract = {We discuss our analysis of long-slit optical spectra of the emission- line nebulae associated with 21 low-redshift (z 〈0.2) radio galaxies. We complement our data with similar data from the literature on 19 other low-redshift radio galaxies. We find that the nebulae can be classified kinematically into three types: rotators, calm nonrotators, and violent nonrotators. The kinematic classification correlates with the relative emission-line strengths in the nebulae and with the optical and radio properties of the galaxies. The nebulae in the rotator class have [O I] 6300 A, [N II] 6584 A, and [S II] 6717 A emission lines that are weak relative to H$\alpha$. The rotators are nearly always associated with galaxies having luminous "high-ionization" nuclear emission-line regions and powerful edge-brightened (Fanaroff and Riley Class II) radio sources. The ionization of the nebulae in these sources is most likely dominated by photoionization from the nuclear continuum source. These galaxies usually inhabit regions of only modest galaxy density. Their radio jet and gas rotation axes are typically aligned to within 20{\^{}}deg{\^{}}. The calm nonrotator nebulae have [O I], [N II], and [S II] lines that are strong relative to H$\alpha$. They are preferentially associated with galaxies having "low-ionization" nuclear emission-line regions and less powerful, edge-dimmed (Fanaroff {\&} Riley Class I) or amorphous radio sources. Heating and photoionization by the surrounding hot (10{\^{}}7-8{\^{}} K) ISM/ICM is likely to provide an important component of the ionization of the nebulae in these sources. These galaxies generally inhabit regions of high galaxy density. The violent nonrotators seem to be more similar to the rotators in their optical/radio properties. We propose that the rotators have dynamically young disks of gas recently acquired by the radio galaxy in an interaction or merger with a gas-rich galaxy. This is consistent with the data on the morphologies, colors, and stellar dynamics of radio galaxies with strong emission lines. This gas may fuel the nuclear activity and appears to be influential in the good collimation of these classical double (FRII class) radio sources. The calm nonrotators include seven radio galaxies with well-known "cooling flows." We suggest that these nebulae are in general the optical signature of a cooling flow which may fuel the active nucleus. The violent nonrotators may be related to the rotators, but either tidal forces or interactions with outflowing radio plasma have induced large noncircular motions in the ionized gas. The association of the large-scale gas kinematics with the radio and optical properties of the active galaxy then suggests that the angular momentum of the gas which fuels the AGN may be an important parameter in the determinant of how activity is manifest in an AGN.},

abstract = {Rotation data are presented for 13 elliptical galaxies, and compared with the oblate models of Gott (1975), Larson (1975), and Wilson (1975). It is found that, on average, most elliptical galaxies have one-third the peak rotational velocity required by these models, with an estimated upper limit of two-thirds the expected rotation. This result is independent of the distance scale. Oblate models in which the flattening is a result of rotation appear to be precluded by these data. Plausible alternatives appear to be that ellipticals are (1) triaxial ellipsoids (or oblate spheroids) in which the flattening is due to remnant anisotropy in the velocity distribution, as suggested by Binney (1978), or (2) rotating prolate ellipsoids, as suggested by Miller (1978). Curiously, one giant elliptical rotates as expected.},

abstract = {We investigate the well-known correlations between the dynamical mass-to-light ratio (M/L) and other global observables of elliptical (E) and lenticular (S0) galaxies. We construct two-integral Jeans and three-integral Schwarzschild dynamical models for a sample of 25 E/S0 galaxies with SAURON integral-field stellar kinematics to about one effective (half-light) radius Re. They have well-calibrated I-band Hubble Space Telescope WFPC2 and large-field ground-based photometry, accurate surface brightness fluctuation distances, and their observed kinematics is consistent with an axisymmetric intrinsic shape. All these factors result in an unprecedented accuracy in the M/L measurements. We find a tight correlation of the form (M/L) = (3.80 {\{}+/-{\}} 0.14) x ({\{}sigma{\}}e/200 km s-1)0.84{\{}+/-{\}}0.07 between the M/L (in the I band) measured from the dynamical models and the luminosity-weighted second moment {\{}sigma{\}}e of the LOSVD within Re. The observed rms scatter in M/L for our sample is 18 per cent, while the inferred intrinsic scatter is [{\~{}}]13 per cent. The (M/L)-{\{}sigma{\}}e relation can be included in the remarkable series of tight correlations between {\{}sigma{\}}e and other galaxy global observables. The comparison of the observed correlations with the predictions of the Fundamental Plane (FP), and with simple virial estimates, shows that the tilt' of the FP of early-type galaxies, describing the deviation of the FP from the virial relation, is almost exclusively due to a real M/L variation, while structural and orbital non-homology have a negligible effect. When the photometric parameters are determined in the classic' way, using growth curves, and the {\{}sigma{\}}e is measured in a large aperture, the virial mass appears to be a reliable estimator of the mass in the central regions of galaxies, and can be safely used where more expensive' models are not feasible (e.g. in high-redshift studies). In this case the best-fitting virial relation has the form (M/L)vir = (5.0 {\{}+/-{\}} 0.1) xRe{\{}sigma{\}}[IMG]f1.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0"{\textgreater}/(LG), in reasonable agreement with simple theoretical predictions. We find no difference between the M/L of the galaxies in clusters and in the field. The comparison of the dynamical M/L with the (M/L)pop inferred from the analysis of the stellar population, indicates a median dark matter fraction in early-type galaxies of [{\~{}}]30 per cent of the total mass inside one Re, in broad agreement with previous studies, and it also shows that the stellar initial mass function varies little among different galaxies. Our results suggest a variation in M/L at constant (M/L)pop, which seems to be linked to the galaxy dynamics. We speculate that fast-rotating galaxies have lower dark matter fractions than the slow-rotating and generally more-massive ones. If correct, this would suggest a connection between the galaxy assembly history and the dark matter halo structure. The tightness of our correlation provides some evidence against cuspy nuclear dark matter profiles in galaxies.},

@article{Allen2006,
abstract = {Using Chandra X-ray observations of nine nearby, X-ray luminous elliptical galaxies with good optical velocity dispersion measurements, we show that a tight correlation exists between the Bondi accretion rates calculated from the observed gas temperature and density profiles and estimated black hole masses, and the power emerging from these systems in relativistic jets. The jet powers, which are inferred from the energies and time-scales required to inflate cavities observed in the surrounding X-ray emitting gas, can be related to the accretion rates using a power-law model of the form log(PBondi/1043ergs-1) = A + Blog(Pjet/1043ergs-1), with A = 0.65 +/- 0.16 and B = 0.77 +/- 0.20. Our results show that a significant fraction of the energy associated with the rest mass of material entering the Bondi accretion radius (2.2+1.0-0.7 per cent, for Pjet = 1043ergs-1) eventually emerges in the relativistic jets. The data also hint that this fraction may rise slightly with increasing jet power. Our results have significant implications for studies of accretion, jet formation and galaxy formation. The observed tight correlation suggests that the Bondi formulae provide a reasonable description of the accretion process in these systems, despite the likely presence of magnetic pressure and angular momentum in the accreting gas. The similarity of the PBondi and Pjet values argues that a significant fraction of the matter entering the accretion radius flows down to regions close to the black holes, where the jets are presumably formed. The tight correlation between PBondi and Pjet also suggests that the accretion flows are approximately stable over time-scales of a few million years. Our results show that the black hole `engines' at the hearts of large elliptical galaxies and groups can feed back sufficient energy to stem cooling and star formation, leading naturally to the observed exponential cut off at the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function.},

abstract = {We present analysis of Chandra and XMM-Newton observations of three early-type galaxies, NGC 57, NGC 7796 and IC 1531. All three are found in very low density environments, and appear to have no neighbours of comparable size. NGC 57 has a halo of kT{\~{}}0.9 keV, solar metallicity gas, while NGC 7796 and IC 1531 both have {\~{}}0.55 keV, 0.5-0.6 Zsol haloes. IC 1531 has a relatively compact halo, and we consider it likely that gas has been removed from the system by the effects of AGN heating. For NGC 57 and NGC 7796 we estimate mass, entropy and cooling time profiles and find that NGC 57 has a fairly massive dark halo with a mass-to-light ratio of 44.7 (4.0,-8.5) Msol/Lsol (1 sigma uncertainties) at 4.75 Re. This is very similar to the mass-to-light ratio found for NGC 4555 and confirms that isolated ellipticals can possess sizable dark matter haloes. We find a significantly lower mass-to-light ratio for NGC 7796, 10.6 (+2.5,-2.3) Msol/Lsol at 5 Re, and discuss the possibility that NGC 7796 hosts a galactic wind, causing us to underestimate its mass.},

abstract = {Radio AGN feedback is often assumed to work, but detailed physical models of this process are not well developed. This paper examines a possible path for radio AGN feedback to heat the gas in and around galaxies and perhaps suppress star formation. Nearby radio AGN are almost all FR-I radio galaxies, and it is argued that such outflows become decelerated and fully turbulent in their early stages. A 3D non-linear MHD turbulence calculation is made to determine the time required for this outflowing turbulent energy to be converted into heat. Using radio and x-ray observations of nearby FR-I AGN for normalization results in a time for the onset of heating of about 100 million years. This is comparable to the gas cooling times in and around galaxies, and the resulting location of heat deposition is consistent with FR-I outflows.},

@article{Heckman1986,
abstract = {The authors discuss a program of deep optical broad- and narrow-band imaging of 43 radio galaxies, supplemented by optical long-slit spectroscopy and VLA radio mapping. The principal result is that between one-fourth and one-third of very powerful radio galaxies are strongly peculiar in optical morphology at relatively high levels of surface brightness. This fraction is much greater than for less powerful radio galaxies and for radio-quiet ellipticals. The morphological peculiarities take the form of tails, fans, bridges, dust features, shells, etc. They probably arise from the collision or merger of galaxy pairs, at least one member of which is a disk galaxy. Two idealized classes of radio galaxies are proposed. Class A galaxies have strong optical emission lines and frequently peculiar optical morphologies. These may be radio sources fueled by collisions or mergers involving at least one gas-rich system. Class B galaxies have weak or no optical emission lines and are morphologically normal giant elliptical or cD galaxies. These radio sources may be powered by the stored rotational energy of a central black hole or by accretion of an intracluster medium.},

abstract = {We investigate line-of-sight velocity distribution (LOSVD) corrections for absorption line-strength indices of early-type galaxies in the Lick/IDS system. This system is often used to estimate basic stellar population parameters such as luminosity weighted ages and metallicities. Using single stellar population model spectral energy distributions by Vazdekis (1999) we find that the LOSVD corrections are largely insensitive to changes in the stellar populations for old galaxies (age {\textgreater}3 Gyr). Only the Lick/IDS Balmer series indices show an appreciable effect, which is on the order of the correction itself. Furthermore, we investigate the sensitivity of the LOSVD corrections to non-Gaussian LOSVDs. In this case the LOSVD can be described by a Gauss-Hermite series and it is shown that typical values of h{\_}3 and h{\_}4 observed in early-type galaxies can lead to significant modifications of the LOSVD corrections and thus to changes in the derived luminosity weighted ages and metallicities. A new, simple parameterisation for the LOSVD corrections, taking into account the h{\_}3 and h{\_}4 terms, is proposed and calibrations given for a subset of the Lick/IDS indices and two additional indices applicable to old ({\textgreater}3 Gyr) stellar populations.},

@article{Graves2008,
abstract = {We present a method for determining mean light-weighted ages and abundances of Fe, Mg, C, N, and Ca, from medium resolution spectroscopy of unresolved stellar populations. The method, pioneered by Schiavon (2007), is implemented in a publicly available code called EZ{\_}Ages. The method and error estimation are described, and the results tested for accuracy and consistency, by application to integrated spectra of well-known Galactic globular and open clusters. Ages and abundances from integrated light analysis agree with studies of resolved stars to within +/-0.1 dex for most clusters, and to within +/-0.2 dex for nearly all cases. The results are robust to the choice of Lick indices used in the fitting to within +/-0.1 dex, except for a few systematic deviations which are clearly categorized. The realism of our error estimates is checked through comparison with detailed Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, we apply EZ{\_}Ages to the sample of galaxies presented in Thomas et al. (2005) and compare our derived values of age, [Fe/H], and [alpha/Fe] to their analysis. We find that [alpha/Fe] is very consistent between the two analyses, that ages are consistent for old (Age {\textgreater} 10 Gyr) populations, but show modest systematic differences at younger ages, and that [Fe/H] is fairly consistent, with small systematic differences related to the age systematics. Overall, EZ{\_}Ages provides accurate estimates of fundamental parameters from medium resolution spectra of unresolved stellar populations in the old and intermediate-age regime, for the first time allowing quantitative estimates of the abundances of C, N, and Ca in these unresolved systems. The EZ{\_}Ages code can be downloaded at http://www.ucolick.org/{\~{}}graves/EZ{\_}Ages.html},

@article{Kobayashi1999,
abstract = {We have re-studied line-strength gradients of 80 elliptical galaxies. Typical metallicity gradients are d[Fe/H]/dlogr = -0.3. The metallicity gradients do not correlate with any physical properties of galaxies, including central and mean metallicities, central velocity dispersions sigma0, absolute B-magnitudes MB, absolute effective radii Re, and dynamical masses of galaxies. By using the metallicity gradients, we have calculated mean stellar metallicities for individual ellipticals. Typical mean stellar metallicities are {\textless}[Fe/H]{\textgreater} = -0.3. The mean metallicities correlate well with sigma0 and dynamical masses, though relations for MB and Re include significant scatters. We find fundamental planes defined by surface brightnesses SBe, {\textless}[Fe/H]{\textgreater}, and Re (or MB), and the scatters of which are much smaller than those of the {\textless}[Fe/H]{\textgreater}-Re (or MB) relations. The {\textless}[Fe/H]{\textgreater}-sigma0 relation is nearly in parallel to the [Fe/H]0- sigma0 relation but systematically lower by 0.3 dex. The metallicity-mass relation, or equivalently, the color-magnitude relation holds not only for the central part but also for the whole part of galaxies. Using Mg2 and Fe1, we find {\textless}[Mg/Fe]{\textgreater} = +0.2 in most of ellipticals. {\textless}[Mg/Fe]{\textgreater} shows no correlation with galaxy mass tracers. This can be most naturally explained if the star formation had stopped in ellipticals before the bulk of Type Ia supernovae began to explode. Ellipticals can have significantly different metallicity gradients and {\textless}[Fe/H]{\textgreater} even if they have the same galaxy mass. This may result from galaxy mergers, but no evidence is found from presently available data to support the same origin for metallicity gradients, the scatters around metallicity-mass relation, and dynamical disturbances. This may suggest that the scatters have their origin at the formation epoch of galaxies.},

abstract = {We study the stellar populations of 1,923 elliptical galaxies at z{\textless}0.05 selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey as a function of velocity dispersion, sigma, and environment. We construct average, high signal-to-noise spectra and find the following: (1) lower-sigma galaxies have a bluer optical continuum and stronger (but still weak) emission lines; (2) at fixed sigma, field ellipticals have a slightly bluer stellar continuum, especially at wavelengths $\backslash$lesssim 4000 $\backslash$AA, and have stronger (but still weak) emission lines compared to their group counterparts, although this environmental dependence is strongest for low-sigma ellipticals. Based on Lick indices measured from both the individual and average spectra, we find that: (1) at a given sigma, elliptical galaxies in groups have systematically weaker Balmer absorption than their field counterparts, although this environmental dependence is most pronounced at low sigma; (2) there is no clear environmental dependence of {\textless}Fe{\textgreater}, while the alpha-element absorption indices such as Mgb are only slightly stronger in galaxies belonging to rich groups. An analysis based on simple stellar populations (SSPs) reveals that more massive elliptical galaxies are older, more metal-rich and more strongly alpha-enhanced. We also find that: (1) the SSP-equivalent ages of galaxies in rich groups are, on average, {\~{}}1 Gyr older than in the field, although once again this effect is strongest at low sigma; (2) galaxies in rich groups have slightly lower [Fe/H] and are marginally more strongly alpha-enhanced; and (3) there is no significant environmental dependence of total metallicity, [Z/H]. Our results are generally consistent with stronger low-level recent star formation in field ellipticals at low sigma, similar to recent results based on ultraviolet and infrared observations.

abstract = {We have investigated the properties of a volume and magnitude limited sample of nearby early type galaxies that were carefully selected from the AAO two degree field galaxy redshift survey. We used images from the DSS to confirm the E/S0 morphologies, and augmented this sample with field galaxies from Colbert et al. 2001. We present spectroscopic observations of 22 galaxies from the combined sample, from which central velocity dispersions and the Lick stellar population indices were measured. After carefully correcting the spectra for nebular emission we derived luminosity-weighted ages, metallicities, and alpha-element abundance ratios. We compare these isolated galaxies with samples of early-type galaxies in the Virgo and Coma clusters, and also with the sample of galaxies in low-density regions of Kuntschner et al. (2002). We find that galaxies in low-density environments are younger and have a greater spread of ages compared to cluster galaxies. They also show a wider range of metallicities at a given velocity dispersion than cluster galaxies, which display only super-solar metallicities. On average cluster, as well as, isolated galaxies show non-solar abundance ratios in alpha-elements, suggesting that, independent of galactic environment, star formation occurred on short time-scales. We reason that early-type galaxies in low-density environments experienced merging-induced star-formation episodes over a longer and more recent period of time compared to a cluster environment, and speculate that a considerable fraction of their stars formed out of low-metallicity halo gaseous material during the slow growth of a stellar disk between merging events.},

We find that the BGGs and BCGs have very uniform masses, central ages and central metallicities. Examining the radial dependence of their stellar populations, we find no significant velocity dispersion, age, or alpha-enhancement gradients. However, we find a wide range of metallicity gradients, suggesting a variety of formation mechanisms. The range of metallicity gradients observed is surprising given the homogeneous environment these galaxies probe and their uniform central stellar populations. However, our results are inconsistent with any single model of galaxy formation and emphasize the need for more theoretical understanding of both the origins of metallicity gradients and galaxy formation itself. We postulate two possible physical causes for the different formation mechanisms.},

abstract = {There is good evidence that the centers of massive early-type galaxies have a bottom-heavy stellar initial mass function (IMF) compared to the IMF of the Milky Way. Here we study the radial variation of the IMF within such galaxies, using a combination of high quality Keck spectroscopy and a new suite of stellar population synthesis models that cover a wide range in metallicity. As in the previous studies in this series, the models are fitted directly to the spectra and treat all elemental abundance ratios as free parameters. Using newly obtained spectroscopy for six galaxies, including deep data extending to {\~{}}1Re for the galaxies NGC1407, NGC1600, and NGC2695, we find that the IMF varies strongly with galactocentric radius. For all six galaxies the IMF is bottom-heavy in the central regions, with average mass-to-light ratio "mismatch" parameter a{\~{}}2.5 at r=0. The IMF rapidly becomes more bottom-light with increasing radius, flattening off near the Milky Way value (a{\~{}}1.1) at R{\textgreater}0.4Re. A consequence is that the luminosity-weighted average IMF depends on the measurement aperture: within R=Re we find {\textless}a{\textgreater}=1.3-1.5, consistent with recent lensing and dynamical results from SLACS and ATLAS-3D. Our results are also consistent with several earlier studies that were based on analyses of radial gradients of line indices. The observed IMF gradients support galaxy formation models in which the central regions of massive galaxies had a different formation history than their outer parts. Finally, we make use of the high signal-to-noise central spectra of NGC1407 and NGC2695 to demonstrate that we are indeed measuring IMF effects, not abundance effects.},

abstract = {We present high-resolution Very Large Array imaging of the molecular gas in the host galaxy of the high redshift quasar BRI 1335-0417 (z=4.41). Our CO(2-1) observations have a linear resolution of 0.15" (1.0 kpc) and resolve the molecular gas emission both spatially and in velocity. The molecular gas in BRI 1335-0417 is extended on scales of 5 kpc, and shows a complex structure. At least three distinct components encompassing about two thirds of the total molecular mass of 9.2 x 10{\^{}}10 M{\_}sun are identified in velocity space, which are embedded in a structure that harbors about one third of the total molecular mass in the system. The brightest CO(2-1) line emission region has a peak brightness temperature of 61+/-9 K within 1 kpc diameter, which is comparable to the kinetic gas temperature as predicted from the CO line excitation. This is also comparable to the gas temperatures found in the central regions of nearby ultra-luminous infrared galaxies, which are however much more compact than 1 kpc. The spatial and velocity structure of the molecular reservoir in BRI 1335-0417 is inconsistent with a simple gravitationally bound disk, but resembles a merging system. Our observations are consistent with a major, gas-rich (`wet') merger that both feeds an accreting supermassive black hole (causing the bright quasar activity), and fuels a massive starburst that builds up the stellar bulge in this galaxy. Our study of this z{\textgreater}4 quasar host galaxy may thus be the most direct observational evidence that `wet' mergers at high redshift are related to AGN activity.},

abstract = {We have analyzed Hubble Space Telescope WFPC2 F555W and F814W (i.e., V and I) images for 15 elliptical galaxies with kinematically distinct cores. For each of them, we have derived surface brightness and isophotal parameter profiles in the two bands, color maps, and radial profiles in V - I. Most galaxies show patchy dust absorption close to their nuclei. However, there are generally no indications of homogeneous, diffuse dust components close to the nuclei. The nuclear colors in the unobscured regions are most likely representative of the central stellar populations.

We have detected photometric evidence for faint stellar disks, on scales of a few tens to a few arcseconds, in seven galaxies, namely NGC 1427, 1439, 1700, 4365, 4406, 4494, and 5322. In NGC 1700, the isophotes are slightly boxy at the scale of the counterrotating component and disky at larger radii. We find no difference in V - I color greater than 0.02 mag between these disks and the surrounding galactic regions. Hence, the stellar populations in the kinematically distinct cores are not strongly deviant from the population of the main body. Specifically, there is no evidence for a dominating population of blue, very metal weak stars as predicted by some of the formation scenarios. This argues against models in which small galaxies fall in and survive in the nuclei, unless supermassive black holes are present. These would likely disrupt the accreted small systems.

For one galaxy, NGC 4365, the innermost region is bluer than the surrounding regions. This area extends to {\~{}}15 pc and contains a luminosity of {\~{}}2.5 × 106 L☉. If interpreted as a stellar population effect, an age difference of {\~{}}3-4 Gyr, or an [Fe/H] variation of about 0.2 dex, is derived.

The nuclear intensity profiles show a large variety: some galaxies have steep cusp profiles, while others have shallow cusps and a "break radius." The nuclear cusps of galaxies with kinematically distinct cores follow the same trends as the nuclei of normal galaxies.

We have not been able to identify a unique, qualifying feature in the WFPC2 images that distinguishes the galaxies with kinematically distinct cores from the kinematically normal cores. It is possible that statistical differences exist: possibly, the kinematically distinct cores have a higher fraction of nuclear disks. The similarity of both types of cores puts strong constraints on the formation scenarios. Simulations of galaxy mergers, with the inclusion of star formation and nuclear black holes, are needed to resolve the question of how these structures may have formed. Spectra with high spatial resolution are needed to study the nuclear structure of the distinct component in detail.},

These trends are in good agreement with observations of early-type galaxies, and are consistent with a `downsizing' galaxy formation scenario: more massive galaxies have formed the bulk of their stars earlier and more rapidly, hence from an interstellar medium that was mostly {\$}\backslashalpha{\$}-enriched by massive stars. In the absence of feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN), however, {\$}[\backslashalpha/\backslashmathrm{\{}Fe{\}}]{\_}{\{}\backslashast{\}}{\$} in {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashast{\}} {\textgreater} 10{\^{}}{\{}10.5{\}}{\$} M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$} galaxies is roughly constant with stellar mass and decreases with mean stellar age, extending the trends found for lower-mass galaxies in both simulations with and without AGN. We conclude that AGN feedback can account for the {\$}\backslashalpha{\$}-enhancement of massive galaxies, as it suppresses their star formation, quenching more massive galaxies at earlier times, thereby preventing the iron from longer-lived intermediate-mass stars (supernova Type Ia) from being incorporated into younger stars.},

abstract = {The second catalog of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) detected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) in two years of scientific operation is presented. The Second LAT AGN Catalog (2LAC) includes 1017 gamma-ray sources located at high Galactic latitudes (|b|{\textgreater}10{\{}$\backslash$deg{\}}) that are detected with a test statistic greater than 25 and associated statistically with AGNs. However some of these are affected by analysis issues and some are associated with multiple AGNs. Consequently we define a clean sample which includes 886 AGNs, comprising 395 BL Lacertae objects (BL Lacs), 310 flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), 157 candidate blazars of unknown type (i.e., with broad-band blazar characteristics but with no optical spectral measurement yet), eight misaligned AGNs, four narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1s), 10 AGNs of other types and two starburst galaxies. Where possible, the blazars have been further classified based on their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) as archival radio, optical, and X-ray data permit. While almost all FSRQs have a synchrotron-peak frequency 10{\^{}}14 Hz, about half of the BL Lacs have a synchrotron-peak frequency {\textgreater}10{\^{}}15 Hz. The 2LAC represents a significant improvement relative to the First LAT AGN Catalog (1LAC), with 52{\%} more associated sources. The full characterization of the newly detected sources will require more broad-band data. Various properties, such as gamma-ray fluxes and photon power law spectral indices, redshifts, gamma-ray luminosities, variability, and archival radio luminosities---and their correlations are presented and discussed for the different blazar classes. The general trends observed in 1LAC are confirmed.},

abstract = {We present a multi-scale and multi-frequency study of the radio galaxy IC1531 (z=0.026) with Chandra, XMM-Newton and Fermi. The Chandra image shows an X-ray core and 5 extended emission with the radio jet. The X-ray spectrum of the core is well fitted by a power law ({\OE}{\`{i}}=2.2). The X-ray emission of the large scale jet is most-likely synchrotron emission, further confirming the low-power source classication. The gamma-ray analisys shows a 5-days variability, from which it is possible to estimate the size of the emitting region. We present a study of the spectral energy distribution of the core of IC1531 from radio to gamma-ray emission. The models allowed us to determine the nature of the gamma-ray emission and infer the jet kinetic power at sub-pc scales. The jet power at kpc scales is estimated from the total radio luminosity at 151 MHz. Finally, we compare the jet power with the disk luminosity. We discuss our results in terms of the formation and evolution of the jet.},

abstract = {We study a sample of 44 low-luminosity radio-loud AGN, which represent a range of nuclear radio-power spanning 5 orders of magnitude, to unveil the accretion mechanism in these galaxies. We estimate the accretion rate of gas associated with their hot coronae by analyzing archival Chandra data, to derive the deprojected density and temperature profiles in a spherical approximation. Measuring the jet power from the nuclear radio-luminosity, we find that the accretion power correlates linearly with the jet power, with an efficiency of conversion from rest mass into jet power of {\~{}}0.012. These results strengthen and extend the validity of the results obtained by Allen and collaborators for 9 radio galaxies, indicating that hot gas accretion is the dominant process in FR I radio galaxies across their full range of radio-luminosity. We find that the different levels of nuclear activity are driven by global differences in the structure of the galactic hot coronae. A linear relation links the jet power with the host X-ray surface brightness. This implies that a substantial change in the jet power must be accompanied by a global change in its ISM properties, driven for example by a major merger. This correlation provides a simple widely applicable method to estimate the jet-power of a given object by observing the intensity of its host X-ray emission. To maintain the mass flow in the jet, the fraction of gas that crosses the Bondi radius reaching the accretion disk must be {\textgreater} 0.002. This implies that the radiative efficiency of the disk must be {\textless} 0.005, an indication that accretion in these objects occurs not only at a lower rate, but also at lower efficiency than in standard accretion disks.},

abstract = {Early-type galaxies (E and S0) are cornerstones in the study of galaxy formation and evolution as their stellar populations provide strong constraints on these processes, specially when associated to its mass and environment. In order to do this kind of study we used spectroscopic observations carried out at the 1.52 m ESO telescope for a sample of 509 early-type galaxies. We performed two types of spectra extraction: one takes into account most of the light of the galaxy, and is refered as global extraction; the other one consists of several contiguous, and small extractions along the major axis of the galaxy to allow gradient studies for a sub-sample of 137 galaxies. We measured several indices in the Lick system and using the SSP model of Thomas et al. (2003) we determine ages and metallicities. Examining the index-$\sigma$0 relation, we do not find any significant difference for it, taking into account distinct morphologies and environments. The slope of this relation seems to be chiefly caused by variation of metallicity, and secondarily by [$\alpha$/Fe] and age. We also find a correlation between residuals of this relation with the H$\beta$ index, an age indicator, however the residuals for Mg and Fe indexes show different behaviors with H$\beta$. This suggests that variation in [$\alpha$/Fe] ratio also plays a role in the scatter of the index-$\sigma$0 relation, rather than age alone. Examining the parameters obtained from SSP models and how it relate to mass ($\sigma$0), we find that low mass galaxies viii present [Z/H], ages and [$\alpha$/Fe] values, on average, smaller than that of massive objects, confirming what is generally known as the downsizing effect. No clear effects of distinct morphologies and environments are reported on the relations between age, [Z/H], and [$\alpha$/Fe] with mass. Average values of ∆I are similar for both morphological types and environments, nevertheless, their distributions are not. The ∆I-$\sigma$0 or ∆[Z/H]-$\sigma$0 do not depend on morphology or surroundings, and also do not show correlation with $\sigma$0. Also, ∆T and ∆[$\alpha$/Fe] show no significant correlation with $\sigma$0, and have a distribution consistent with a null average. The above evidences favours both scenarios, Monolithic Dissipative Collapse and Hierarchical Clustering, so we may consider a unified scenario for galaxy formation where in a clustering scenery, galaxies can form rapidly as in a monolithic dissipative like process.},

abstract = {We report on spectroscopic observations of three elliptical galaxies, NGC 4472, NGC 5813 and IC 4296. Rotation curves, velocity dispersion profiles and line-strength profiles have been obtained using two methods, the Fourier quotient method of Sargent et al. (1977) and the cross-correlation method of Tonry {\&} Davis. Good agreement was found between these methods. NGC 4472 and 5813 are found to rotate slowly, providing additional support to the hypothesis that the shapes of elliptical galaxies are due to velocity anisotropics rather than rotation. IC 4296 rotates quite rapidly, consistent with isotropic oblate models. Spectra obtained along the minor axis of each galaxy show little evidence for minor axis rotation, except possibly for NGC 5813. The velocity dispersion profiles for NGC 5813 and IC 4296 are flat, implying a mass distribution $\rho$(r)∝r−2$\rho$(r)∝r−2. Isophotometry has been obtained for each galaxy. NGC 4472 and 5813 show isophote twists and outwardly increasing ellipticities. Mass to light ratios have been determined for each galaxy and also for 10 galaxies in Schechter {\&} Gunn's sample. We find (M/L)B∼7(M/L)B∼7 in the inner regions (r ≈ 5kpc) of elliptical galaxies (assuming H0 = 50 km s−1 Mpc−1).},

abstract = {In this paper we analyze the measurements of the absorption line-strength Lick indices in the early-type galaxy IC 1459. We use the long-slit spectra of the elliptical galaxy IC 1459 from which its kinematics had previously been extracted to calculate the Lick indices for the observed spectral region (Mg2, Fe5270, Fe5335 and H$\beta$). We apply the usual procedure and correct the indices to the Lick spectral resolution and for the zero velocity dispersion. The procedure applied in this paper also corrects to non-Gaussian line-of-sight velocity distribution (LOSVD) observed in this galaxy, especially in its outer parts. The findings of Kuntschner (2004) were tested and it is shown that the departures from the Gaussian LOSVD may indeed cause erroneous determinations of the Lick indices. The impact of the introduction of non-Gaussian LOSVD differs for different indices. For the galaxy IC 1459 it is shown that the iron indices are especially sensitive when the correction due to anistropies is introduced: the corrections for Fe5270 and Fe5335 are {\~{}}10 and {\~{}}19 percent larger, respectively, than the corrections obtained in case of a pure Gaussian. The corrections for Mg2 index are shown to be negligible and the corrections of the H$\beta$ index due to anisotropies are also small (below {\~{}} 4 per cent at most).},

abstract = {We present HI imaging of the galaxy group IC 1459 carried out with six antennas of the Australian SKA Pathfinder equipped with phased-array feeds. We detect and resolve HI in eleven galaxies down to a column density of {\$}\backslashsim10{\^{}}{\{}20{\}}{\$} cm{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}{\$} inside a {\~{}}6 deg{\$}{\^{}}2{\$} field and with a resolution of {\~{}}1 arcmin on the sky and {\~{}}8 km/s in velocity. We present HI images, velocity fields and integrated spectra of all detections, and highlight the discovery of three HI clouds -- two in the proximity of the galaxy IC 5270 and one close to NGC 7418. Each cloud has an HI mass of {\$}10{\^{}}9{\$} M{\$}{\_}\backslashodot{\$} and accounts for {\~{}}15{\%} of the HI associated with its host galaxy. Available images at ultraviolet, optical and infrared wavelengths do not reveal any clear stellar counterpart of any of the clouds, suggesting that they are not gas-rich dwarf neighbours of IC 5270 and NGC 7418. Using Parkes data we find evidence of additional extended, low-column-density HI emission around IC 5270, indicating that the clouds are the tip of the iceberg of a larger system of gas surrounding this galaxy. This result adds to the body of evidence on the presence of intra-group gas within the IC 1459 group. Altogether, the HI found outside galaxies in this group amounts to several times {\$}10{\^{}}9{\$} M{\$}{\_}\backslashodot{\$}, at least 10{\%} of the HI contained inside galaxies. This suggests a substantial flow of gas in and out of galaxies during the several billion years of the group's evolution.},

abstract = {The source of hot gas in elliptical galaxies is thought to be due to stellar mass loss, with contributions from supernova events and possibly from infall from a surrounding environment. This picture predicts supersolar values for the metallicity of the gas toward the inner part of the galaxy, which can be tested by measuring the gas phase abundances. We use high-quality data for 10 nearby early-type galaxy from XMM-Newton, featuring both the EPIC and the Reflection Grating Spectrometer, where the strongest emission lines are detected with little blending; some Chandra data are also used. We find excellent consistency in the elemental abundances between the different XMM instruments and good consistency with Chandra. Differences in abundances with aperture size and model complexity are examined, but large differences rarely occur. For a two-temperature thermal model plus a point source contribution, the median Fe and O abundances are 0.86 and 0.44 of the Solar value, while Si and Mg abundances are similar to that for Fe. This is similar to stellar abundances for these galaxies but supernovae were expected to enhance the gas phase abundances considerably, which is not observed.},

abstract = {We present an initial analysis of a new XMM observation of NGC 1399, the central elliptical galaxy of the Fornax group. Spectral fitting of the spatially resolved spectral data of the EPIC MOS and pn CCDs reveals that a two-temperature model (2T) of the hot gas is favored over single-phase and cooling flow models within the central {\~{}}20 kpc. The preference for the 2T model applies whether or not the data are deprojected. The cooler component has a temperature ({\~{}}0.9 keV) similar to the kinetic temperature of the stars while the hotter component has a temperature ({\~{}}1.5 keV) characteristic of the virial temperature of a {\~{}}10{\^{}}{\{}13{\}} M{\_}sun halo. The two-phase model (and other multitemperature models) removes the ``Fe Bias'' within r {\textless} {\~{}}20 kpc and gives Z{\_}Fe/Z{\_}sun 1.5-2. At larger radii the iron abundance decreases until Z{\_}Fe/Z{\_}sun $\backslash${\~{}}0.5 for r {\~{}}50 kpc. The Si abundance is super-solar (1.2-1.7 solar) within the central regions while Z{\_}Si/Z{\_}Fe {\~{}}0.8 over the entire region studied. These Fe and Si abundances imply that {\~{}}80{\%} of the Fe mass within r {\~{}}50 kpc originates from Type Ia supernovae (SNIa). This SNIa fraction is similar to that inferred for the Sun and therefore suggests a stellar initial mass function similar to the Milky Way.},

We obtained WFPC2 narrow-band imaging centered on the Halpha+[NII] emission lines to determine the flux distribution of the gas emission at small radii, and we obtained FOS spectra at six aperture positions along the major axis to sample the gas kinematics. We construct different dynamical models for the Halpha+[NII] and Hbeta kinematics that include a supermassive black hole, and in which the stellar mass distribution is constrained by the observed surface brightness distribution and ground-based stellar kinematics. All models are consistent with a black hole mass in the range Mbh=1-4 x 10{\^{}}8 Msun, and models without a black hole are always ruled out at high confidence.},

@article{Delgado2015,
abstract = {This paper characterizes the radial structure of stellar population properties of galaxies in the nearby universe, based on 300 galaxies from the CALIFA survey. The sample covers a wide range of Hubble types, and galaxy stellar mass. We apply the spectral synthesis techniques to recover the stellar mass surface density, stellar extinction, light and mass-weighted ages, and mass-weighted metallicity, for each spatial resolution element in our target galaxies. To study mean trends with overall galaxy properties, the individual radial profiles are stacked in seven bins of galaxy morphology. We confirm that more massive galaxies are more compact, older, more metal rich, and less reddened by dust. Additionally, we find that these trends are preserved spatially with the radial distance to the nucleus. Deviations from these relations appear correlated with Hubble type: earlier types are more compact, older, and more metal rich for a given mass, which evidences that quenching is related to morphology, but not driven by mass. Negative gradients of ages are consistent with an inside-out growth of galaxies, with the largest ages gradients in Sb-Sbc galaxies. Further, the mean stellar ages of disks and bulges are correlated, with disks covering a wider range of ages, and late type spirals hosting younger disks. The gradients in stellar mass surface density depend mostly on stellar mass, in the sense that more massive galaxies are more centrally concentrated. There is a secondary correlation in the sense that at the same mass early type galaxies have steeper gradients. We find mildly negative metallicity gradients, shallower than predicted from models of galaxy evolution in isolation. The largest gradients occur in Sb galaxies. Overall we conclude that quenching processes act in manners that are independent of mass, while metallicity and galaxy structure are influenced by mass-dependent processes.},

In this paper, we derive spatially resolved stellar population properties and radial gradients by performing full spectral fitting of observed galaxy spectra from P-MaNGA, a prototype of the MaNGA instrument. These data include spectra for eighteen galaxies, covering a large range of morphological type. We derive age, metallicity, dust and stellar mass maps, and their radial gradients, using high spectral-resolution stellar population models, and assess the impact of varying the stellar library input to the models. We introduce a method to determine dust extinction which is able to give smooth stellar mass maps even in cases of high and spatially non-uniform dust attenuation. With the spectral fitting we produce detailed maps of stellar population properties which allow us to identify galactic features among this diverse sample such as spiral structure, smooth radial profiles with little azimuthal structure in spheroidal galaxies, and spatially distinct galaxy sub-components. In agreement with the literature, we find the gradients for galaxies identified as early-type to be on average flat in age, and negative (- 0.15 dex / R{\$}{\_}e{\$} ) in metallicity, whereas the gradients for late-type galaxies are on average negative in age (- 0.39 dex / R{\$}{\_}e{\$} ) and flat in metallicity. We demonstrate how different levels of data quality change the precision with which radial gradients can be measured. We show how this analysis, extended to the large numbers of MaNGA galaxies, will have the potential to shed light on galaxy structure and evolution.},

abstract = {Reduced chi-squared is a very popular method for model assessment, model comparison, convergence diagnostic, and error estimation in astronomy. In this manuscript, we discuss the pitfalls involved in using reduced chi-squared. There are two independent problems: (a) The number of degrees of freedom can only be estimated for linear models. Concerning nonlinear models, the number of degrees of freedom is unknown, i.e., it is not possible to compute the value of reduced chi-squared. (b) Due to random noise in the data, also the value of reduced chi-squared itself is subject to noise, i.e., the value is uncertain. This uncertainty impairs the usefulness of reduced chi-squared for differentiating between models or assessing convergence of a minimisation procedure. The impact of noise on the value of reduced chi-squared is surprisingly large, in particular for small data sets, which are very common in astrophysical problems. We conclude that reduced chi-squared can only be used with due caution for linear models, whereas it must not be used for nonlinear models at all. Finally, we recommend more sophisticated and reliable methods, which are also applicable to nonlinear models.},

The galaxies span a factor of 20 in intrinsic luminosity, as well as a full range of environment and ETG morphology. Our data consist of good velocity resolution (sigma{\_}inst {\~{}} 25 km/s) integrated stellar-light spectra extracted from the individual slitlets of custom made Keck/DEIMOS slitmasks. We extract stellar kinematics measurements (V, sigma, h{\_}3, and h{\_}4) for each galaxy. Combining with literature values from smaller radii, we present 2D spatially resolved maps of the large-scale kinematic structure in each galaxy. We find that the kinematic homogeneity found inside 1 R{\_}e often breaks down at larger radii, where a variety of kinematic behaviors are observed. While central slow rotators remain slowly rotating in their halos, central fast rotators show more diversity, ranging from rapidly increasing to rapidly declining specific angular momentum profiles in the outer regions. There are indications that the outer trends depend on morphological type, raising questions about the proposed unification of the elliptical and lenticular (S0) galaxy families in the ATLAS{\^{}}3D survey. Several galaxies in our sample show multiple lines of evidence for distinct disk components embedded in more slowly rotating spheroids, and we suggest a joint photometric-kinematic approach for robust bulge-disk decomposition. Our observational results appear generally consistent with a picture of two-phase (in-situ plus accretion) galaxy formation.},

abstract = {A new stellar library at the near-IR spectral region developed for the empirical calibration of the Ca II triplet and stellar population synthesis modelling is presented. The library covers the range ll8348–9020 at 1.5-{\AA} (FWHM) spectral resolution, and consists of 706 stars spanning a wide range in atmospheric parameters. We have defined a new set of near-IR indices, CaT*, CaT and PaT, which mostly overcome the limitations of previous definitions, the former being specially suited for the measurement of the Ca II triplet strength corrected for the contamination from Paschen lines. We also present a comparative study of the new and the previous Ca indices, as well as the corresponding transformations between the different systems. A thorough analysis of the sources of index errors and the procedure to calculate them is given. Finally, index and error measurements for the whole stellar library are provided together with the final spectra. With this paper we start a series dedicated to the empirical calibration of the near-IR Ca II triplet. The ultimate aim of this work is to use the strength of the Ca lines in this spectral range to investigate the stellar content of early-type galaxies. However, we expect that researchers in different areas (e.g. starburst and active galaxies, globular clusters, and stellar astrophysics) can make use of some of the results and information that will be presented throughout these papers. These include a new stellar library, a set of homogeneous atmospheric parameters, empirical fitting functions describing the behaviour of the Ca triplet with the stellar parameters, and stellar population model predictions.},

abstract = {While studies of gas-phase metallicity gradients in disc galaxies are common, very little has been done in the acquisition of stellar abundance gradients in the same regions. We present here a comparative study of the stellar metallicity and age distributions in a sample of 62 nearly face-on, spiral galaxies with and without bars, using data from the CALIFA survey. We measure the slopes of the gradients and study their relation with other properties of the galaxies. We find that the mean stellar age and metallicity gradients in the disc are shallow and negative. Furthermore, when normalized to the effective radius of the disc, the slope of the stellar population gradients does not correlate with the mass or with the morphological type of the galaxies. Contrary to this, the values of both age and metallicity at {\$}\backslashsim{\$}2.5 scale-lengths correlate with the central velocity dispersion in a similar manner to the central values of the bulges, although bulges show, on average, older ages and higher metallicities than the discs. One of the goals of the present paper is to test the theoretical prediction that non-linear coupling between the bar and the spiral arms is an efficient mechanism for producing radial migrations across significant distances within discs. The process of radial migration should flatten the stellar metallicity gradient with time and, therefore, we would expect flatter stellar metallicity gradients in barred galaxies. However, we do not find any difference in the metallicity or age gradients in galaxies with without bars. We discuss possible scenarios that can lead to this absence of difference.},

abstract = {We present Gemini GMOS-IFU data of eight compact low-mass early-type galaxies (ETGs) in the Virgo cluster. We analyse their stellar kinematics, stellar population, and present two-dimensional maps of these properties covering the central 5"x 7" region. We find a large variety of kinematics: from non- to highly-rotating objects, often associated with underlying disky isophotes revealed by deep images from the Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey. In half of our objects, we find a centrally-concentrated younger and more metal-rich stellar population. We analyze the specific stellar angular momentum through the lambdaR parameter and find six fast-rotators and two slow-rotators, one having a thin counter-rotating disk. We compare the local galaxy density and stellar populations of our objects with those of 39 more extended low-mass Virgo ETGs from the SMAKCED survey and 260 massive ({\$}M{\textgreater}10{\^{}}{\{}10{\}}{\$}$\backslash$Msun) ETGs from the A3D sample. The compact low-mass ETGs in our sample are located in high density regions, often close to a massive galaxy and have, on average, older and more metal-rich stellar populations than less compact low-mass galaxies. We find that the stellar population parameters follow lines of constant velocity dispersion in the mass-size plane, smoothly extending the comparable trends found for massive ETGs. Our study supports a scenario where low-mass compact ETGs have experienced long-lived interactions with their environment, including ram-pressure stripping and gravitational tidal forces, that may be responsible for their compact nature.},

abstract = {Major progress has been achieved in recent years in mapping the properties of passively-evolving, early-type galaxies (ETG) from the local universe all the way to redshift {\~{}}2. Here, age and metallicity estimates for local cluster and field ETGs are reviewed as based on color-magnitude, color-sigma, and fundamental plane relations, as well as on spectral-line indices diagnostics. The results of applying the same tools at high redshifts are then discussed, and their consistency with the low-redshift results is assessed. Most low- as well as high-redshift (z{\~{}}1) observations consistently indicate 1) a formation redshift z{\textgreater}{\~{}}3 for the bulk of stars in cluster ETGs, with their counterparts in low-density environments being on average {\~{}}1-2 Gyr younger, i.e., formed at z{\textgreater}{\~{}}1.5-2, 2) the duration of the major star formation phase anticorrelates with galaxy mass, and the oldest stellar populations are found in the most massive galaxies. With increasing redshift there is evidence for a decrease in the number density of ETGs, especially of the less massive ones, whereas existing data appear to suggest that most of the most-massive ETGs were already fully assembled at z{\~{}}1. Beyond this redshift, the space density of ETGs starts dropping significantly, and as ETGs disappear, a population of massive, strongly clustered, starburst galaxies progressively becomes more and more prominent, which makes them the likely progenitors to ETGs.},

abstract = {The strength of the H{\$}\backslashbeta{\$} index has been computed for the integrated spectra of model globular clusters from the evolutionary population synthesis. These models take into account, for the first time, the detailed systematic variation of horizontal-branch (HB) morphology with age and metallicity. Our models show that the H{\$}\backslashbeta{\$} index is significantly affected by the presence of blue HB stars. Because of the contribution from blue HB stars, the H{\$}\backslashbeta{\$} does not monotonically decrease as metallicity increases at a given age. Instead, it reaches a maximum strength when the distribution of HB stars is centered around 9500 K, the temperature where the H{\$}\backslashbeta{\$} index becomes strongest. Our models indicate that the strength of the H{\$}\backslashbeta{\$} index increases as much as 0.75 {\{}$\backslash$AA{\}} due to the presence of blue HB stars. The comparison of the recent Keck observations of the globular cluster system in the Milky Way Galaxy with those in giant elliptical galaxies, NGC 1399 and M87, shows a systematic shift in the H{\$}\backslashbeta{\$} against metallicity plane. Our models suggest that this systematic difference is understood if the globular cluster systems in giant elliptical galaxies are several billion years older, in the mean, than the Galactic counterpart. Further observations of globular cluster systems in the external galaxies from the large ground-based telescopes and space UV facilities will enable to clarify whether this difference is indeed due to the age difference or other explanations are also possible.},

abstract = {The present paper reviews our current understanding of the AGN component in sub-mJy radio fields, as it results from the exploitation of multi-frequency information available in two deep extra-galactic radio fields: the ATESP 5 GHz sample and the First Look Survey. One of the key issues addressed here is whether low-power AGNs are more related to efficiently accreting systems (mostly radio-quiet) or to systems with very low accretion rates (mostly radio-loud). The emerging picture is the following. Radio-loud jet-dominated radio galaxies seem to be largely dominant down to flux densities of the order of e.g. S{\textgreater}400 microJy. At lower flux densities (S(1.4 GHz) {\textgreater} 100 microJy) radio-loud AGN are still present in significant numbers. However a population of radio-emitting AGNs, whose properties are consistent with those expected from existing radio-quiet AGN modeling, clearly shows up. This may indicate that the bulk of the radio-quiet AGN population could emerge from studies of deeper (S{\textless}100 microJy) radio samples. The radio-quiet AGN component could be recognised thanks to the availability of IR colors which prove to be especially useful to efficiently separate radio sources triggered by AGNs, from sources triggered by star-formation.},

abstract = {We present a generalisation of surface photometry to the higher-order moments of the line-of-sight velocity distribution of galaxies observed with integral-field spectrographs. The generalisation follows the approach of surface photometry by determining the best fitting ellipses along which the profiles of the moments can be extracted and analysed by means of harmonic expansion. The assumption for the odd moments (e.g. mean velocity) is that the profile along an ellipse satisfies a simple cosine law. The assumption for the even moments (e.g velocity dispersion) is that the profile is constant, as it is used in surface photometry. We find that velocity profiles extracted along ellipses of early-type galaxies are well represented by the simple cosine law (with 2{\%} accuracy), while possible deviations are carried in the fifth harmonic term which is sensitive to the existence of multiple kinematic components, and has some analogy to the shape parameter of photometry. We compare the properties of the kinematic and photometric ellipses and find that they are often very similar. Finally, we offer a characterisation of the main velocity structures based only on the kinemetric parameters which can be used to quantify the features in velocity maps (abridged).},

abstract = {We define a method for analysis of the integrated spectra of extra-galactic globular clusters that provides more reliable measures of age, metallicity and alpha-element abundance ratio than have so far been achieved. The method involves the simultaneous fitting of up to 25 Lick indices in a chi-squared-fitting technique that maximises the use of the available data. Here we compare three sets of single stellar population (SSP) models of Lick indices to the high signal-to-noise, integrated spectra of 20 Galactic globular clusters. The ages, [Fe/H] and alpha-element abundance ratios derived from the SSP models are compared to the results of resolved stellar population studies from the literature. We find good consistency with the published values, with an agreement of better than 0.1 dex in all three derived parameters. The technique allows identification of abundance ratio anomalies, such as the known nitrogen over-abundance in Galactic globular clusters, and the presence of anomalous horizontal-branch morphologies. It also minimises the impact on the derived parameters of imperfect calibration to the Lick system, and reduction errors in general. The method defined in this work is therefore robust with respect to many of the difficulties that plague the application of SSP models in general, and is, consequently, well suited to the study of extra-galactic globular cluster systems.},

The models cover ages between 1 and 15 Gyr, metallicities between 1/200 and 3.5 solar. Our models are free from the intrinsic alpha/Fe bias that was imposed by the Milky Way template stars up to now, hence they reflect well-defined alpha/Fe ratios at all metallicities. The models are calibrated with Milky Way globular clusters for which metallicities and alpha/Fe ratios are known from independent spectroscopy of individual stars. The metallicities that we derive from the Lick indices Mgb and Fe5270 are in excellent agreement with the metallicity scale by Zinn {\&} West (1984), and we show that the latter provides total metallicity rather than iron abundance. We can reproduce the relatively strong CN-absorption features CN1 and CN2 of galactic globular clusters with models in which nitrogen is enhanced by a factor three. An enhancement of carbon, instead, would lead to serious inconsistencies with the indices Mg1 and C24668. The calcium sensitive index Ca4227 of globular clusters is well matched by our models with [Ca/Fe]= 0.3, including the metal-rich Bulge clusters NGC 6528 and NGC 6553. From our alpha/Fe enhanced models we infer that the index [MgFe] defined by Gonzalez (1993) is quite independent of alpha/Fe, but still slightly decreases with increasing alpha/Fe. We define a slight modification of this index that is completely independent of alpha/Fe and serves best as a tracer of total metallicity. Searching for blue indices that give similar information as Mgb and Fe, we find that CN1 and Fe4383 may be best suited to estimate alpha/Fe ratios of objects at redshifts z{\~{}}1. (Abridged)},

abstract = {We perform a spectroscopic study to constrain the stellar Initial Mass Function (IMF) by using a large sample of 24,781 early-type galaxies from the SDSS-based SPIDER survey. Clear evidence is found of a trend between IMF and central velocity dispersion, sigma0, evolving from a standard Kroupa/Chabrier IMF at 100km/s towards a more bottom-heavy IMF with increasing sigma0, becoming steeper than the Salpeter function at sigma0{\textgreater}220km/s. We analyze a variety of spectral indices, corrected to solar scale by means of semi-empirical correlations, and fitted simultaneously with extended MILES (MIUSCAT) stellar population models. Our analysis suggests that sigma0, rather than [alpha/Fe], drives the IMF variation. Although our analysis cannot discriminate between a single power-law (unimodal) and a low-mass ({\textless}0.5MSun) tapered (bimodal) IMF, we can robustly constrain the fraction in low-mass stars at birth, that is found to increase from 20{\%} at sigma0{\~{}}100km/s, up to 80{\%} at sigma0{\~{}}300km/s. Additional constraints can be provided with stellar mass-to-light (M/L) ratios: unimodal models predict M/L significantly larger than dynamical M/L, across the whole sigma0 range, whereas a bimodal IMF is compatible. Our results are robust against individual abundance variations. No significant variation is found in Na and Ca in addition to the expected change from the correlation between [alpha/Fe] and sigma0.

abstract = {The construction of detailed models for intermediate and old stellar populations is described. Input parameters include metallicity (-2 less than (Fe/H) less than 0.5), single-burst age (between 1.5 and 17 Gyr), and initial mass function (IMF) exponent. Quantities output include broadband magnitudes, spectral energy distributions, surface brightness fluctuation magnitudes, and a suite of 21 absorption feature indices. The models are checked against a wide variety of available observations. Examinations of model output yield the following conclusions. (1) If the percentage change delta age/delta Z approximately equals 3/2 for two populations, they will appear almost identical in most indices. A few indices break this degeneracy by being either more abundance sensitive (Fe4668, Fe5015, Fe5709, and Fe5782) or more age sensitive (G4300, H beta, and presumably higher order Balmer lines) than usual. (2) Present uncertainties in stellar evolution are of the same magnitude as the effects of IMF and Y in the indices studied. (3) Changes in abundance ratios (like (Mg/Fe)) are predicted to be readily apparent in the spectra of old stellar populations. (4) The I-band flux of a stellar population is predicted to be nearly independent of metallicity and only modestly sensitive to age. The I band is therefore recommended for standard candle work or studies of M/L in galaxies. Other conclusions stem from this work. (1) Intercomparison of models and observations of two TiO indices seem to indicate variation of the (V/Ti) ratio among galaxies, but it is not clear how this observation ties into the standard picture of chemical enrichment. (2) Current estimates of (Fe/H) for the most metal-rich globulars that are based on integrated indices are probably slightly too high. (3) Colors of population models from different authors exhibit a substantial range. At solar metallicity and 13 Gyr, this range corresponds to an age error of roughly +/- 7 Gyr. Model colors from different authors applied in a differential sense have smaller uncertainties. (4) In the present models the dominant error for colors is probably the transformation from stellar atmospheric parameters to stellar colors. {\textless}(5) Stellar B - V is difficult to model, and current spreads among different authors can reach 0.2 mag. {\&}(6) If known defects in the stellar flux library are corrected, the population model colors of this work in passbands redder than U would be accurate to roughly 0.03 mag in an absolute sense. These corrections are not made in the tables of model output.},

abstract = {We present the results of a high-resolution, 5 GHz, Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array study of the nuclear radio emission in a representative subset of the Atlas3D survey of early-type galaxies (ETGs). We find that 51 +/- 4{\%} of the ETGs in our sample contain nuclear radio emission with luminosities as low as 10{\^{}}18 W/Hz. Most of the nuclear radio sources have compact ({\textless} 25-110 pc) morphologies, although {\textless} 10{\%} display multi-component core+jet or extended jet/lobe structures. Based on the radio continuum properties, as well as optical emission line diagnostics and the nuclear X-ray properties, we conclude that the majority of the central 5 GHz sources detected in the Atlas3D galaxies are associated with the presence of an active galactic nucleus (AGN). However, even at sub-arcsecond spatial resolution, the nuclear radio emission in some cases appears to arise from low-level nuclear star formation rather than an AGN, particularly when molecular gas and a young central stellar population is present. This is in contrast to popular assumptions in the literature that the presence of a compact, unresolved, nuclear radio continuum source universally signifies the presence of an AGN. Additionally, we examine the relationships between the 5 GHz luminosity and various galaxy properties including the molecular gas mass and - for the first time - the global kinematic state. We discuss implications for the growth, triggering, and fueling of radio AGNs, as well as AGN-driven feedback in the continued evolution of nearby ETGs.},

abstract = {We present here the Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Area (CALIFA) survey, which has been designed to provide a first step in this direction.We summarize the survey goals and design, including sample selection and observational strategy.We also showcase the data taken during the first observing runs (June/July 2010) and outline the reduction pipeline, quality control schemes and general characteristics of the reduced data. This survey is obtaining spatially resolved spectroscopic information of a diameter selected sample of {\$}\backslashsim600{\$} galaxies in the Local Universe (0.005{\textless} z {\textless}0.03). CALIFA has been designed to allow the building of two-dimensional maps of the following quantities: (a) stellar populations: ages and metallicities; (b) ionized gas: distribution, excitation mechanism and chemical abundances; and (c) kinematic properties: both from stellar and ionized gas components. CALIFA uses the PPAK Integral Field Unit (IFU), with a hexagonal field-of-view of {\$}\backslashsim1.3\backslashsq\backslasharcmin'{\$}, with a 100{\%} covering factor by adopting a three-pointing dithering scheme. The optical wavelength range is covered from 3700 to 7000 {\{}$\backslash$AA{\}}, using two overlapping setups (V500 and V1200), with different resolutions: R$\backslash$sim850 and R$\backslash$sim1650, respectively. CALIFA is a legacy survey, intended for the community. The reduced data will be released, once the quality has been guaranteed. The analyzed data fulfill the expectations of the original observing proposal, on the basis of a set of quality checks and exploratory analysis. We conclude from this first look at the data that CALIFA will be an important resource for archaeological studies of galaxies in the Local Universe.},

abstract = {We present optical integral field spectroscopy for a flux-limited sample of 19 quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) at low redshift (z {\textless} 0.2) and spatially resolve their ionized gas properties at a physical resolution of 2-5 kpc. Extended ionized gas exists in all QSO host galaxies irrespective of their morphological types. The extended narrow-line regions (ENLRs), photoionized by the radiation of active galactic nuclei (AGN), have sizes of up to several kpc and correlate more strongly with the QSO continuum luminosity at 5100 A than with the integrated [O III] luminosity. We find a relation of the form log r {\{}propto{\}} (0.46 {\{}+/-{\}} 0.04)log L5100, reinforcing the picture of an approximately constant ionization parameter for the ionized clouds across the ENLR. Besides the ENLR, we also find gas ionized by young massive stars in more than 50 per cent of the galaxies on kpc scales. In more than half of the sample, the specific star formation rates based on the extinction-corrected H luminosity are consistent with those of inactive disc-dominated galaxies, even for some bulge-dominated QSO hosts. Enhanced star formation rates of up to [{\~{}}]70 M{\{}odot{\}} yr-1 are rare and always associated with signatures of major mergers. Comparison with the star formation rate based on the 60+100 m far-infrared (FIR) luminosity suggests that the FIR luminosity is systematically contaminated by AGN emission and H appears to be a more robust and sensitive tracer for the star formation rate. Evidence for efficient AGN feedback is scarce in our sample, but some of our QSO hosts lack signatures of ongoing star formation leading to a reduced specific star formation rate with respect to the main sequence of galaxies. Whether this is causally linked to the AGN or simply caused by gas depletion remains an open question. Based on 12 QSOs where we can make measurements, we find that on average bulge-dominated QSO host galaxies tend to fall below the mass-metallicity relation compared to their disc-dominated counterparts. While not yet statistically significant for our small sample, this may provide a useful diagnostic for future large surveys if this metal dilution can be shown to be linked to recent or ongoing galaxy interactions.},

@article{Stasinnska1996,
abstract = {We have constructed a grid of models representing an H II region produced by an evolving starburst embedded in a gas cloud of the same metallicity. The models were produced with the spectral energy distribution from a stellar evolutionary synthesis code as input for a photoionization code that computes the emission-line strengths and equivalent widths. Stellar evolution was assumed to proceed according to the models of Maeder. The radiation field was computed using the Kurucz model atmospheres, supplemented by the expanding non-LTE atmospheres of Schmutz et al. for stellar evolutionary phases with strong winds, making a significant improvement over previous works using classical static, plane-parallel model atmospheres. Models for stellar interiors and atmospheres being still in a phase of continuous improvement, our population synthesis models reflect the state of the art in 1995. The models were used to analyze a sample of 100 H II galaxies for which both the H$\beta$ equivalent widths and the [O III] $\lambda$4363 line intensities were available (the latter allowing a direct determination of the oxygen abundances based on measured electron temperatures). Because of these selection criteria, the results of our study are restricted to metal-poor objects with metallicities less than about one-half solar. The confrontation of models with observations is presented in six diagnostic diagrams involving hydrogen and oxygen lines. Our approach is in many respects much more constraining for the models than previous studies on H II regions ionized by evolving starbursts. We found that the standard starburst model (instantaneous burst of star formation with a Salpeter initial mass function and an upper cutoff mass of 100 M☉) reproduces the observational constraints provided by the nebular emission lines extremely well if selection effects are taken into account. Models with a unique initial mass function are consistent with essentially all observational constraints over a metallicity range from {\~{}}0.025 to {\~{}}0.25 Z☉. In contrast, models with a Salpeter-type initial mass function truncated at 50 M☉ are not consistent with the observations: they violate the observed distribution of H$\beta$ equivalent widths. The mean effective temperature of the ionizing star cluster declines from about 50,000 to 40,000 K during the time when the line [0 III] $\lambda$4363 is strong enough to be measurable. Within the framework of our models, and in the abundance range where comparisons were made with observations, there is no significant evidence for a variation of the star cluster mean effective temperature with metallicity, other than the one generated by the metallicity-dependent stellar atmospheric and evolutionary models. A very narrow range in ionization parameters is required to reproduce the observed line ratios. This should set limits on the dynamical evolution of giant H II regions. We find a large fraction of H II galaxies having [O I] $\lambda$6300/H$\beta$ ratios larger than 0.02. Even models with the lowest ionization parameters considered do not produce these large ratios. An approximate estimate of the mechanical energy released by winds and supernovae during later phases of the starburst leads to the suggestion that the [O I] $\lambda$6300/H$\beta$ ratio in contrast to other line ratios studied is significantly affected by shocks. The small spread in the free parameters necessary to reproduce the emission-line properties of metalpoor H II galaxies allows us to propose a new indicator of the starburst age: the [O III] $\lambda$5007 equivalent width is quite robust and can be used up to larger ages than the traditional H$\beta$ equivalent width for high signal-to-noise spectra. This indicator should also prove useful for low signal-to-noise spectra of star-forming galaxies at higher redshift, because of the large value of [O III] $\lambda$5007/H$\beta$ in starbursts younger than 5 Myr.},

abstract = {This review covers age-dating methods applied to young stellar populations in starburst galaxies with ages of 10{\^{}}8 yr and less. First, recent advances in stellar modeling, both for the interior and the atmospheres, are discussed and spectral lines and colors suitable for age-dating are identified. These age indicators are then applied to single stellar populations, the simplest building blocks of starbursts. More complex systems, such as luminous starburst galaxies, are a challenge for chronometric measurements. The dust reddening, metallicity, stellar initial mass function, and inhomogeneities of the interstellar medium introduce degeneracies which are often hard to resolve. Finally, some shortcomings in the stellar models are highlighted.},

abstract = {We investigate the change in ionizing photons in galaxies between 0.2{\textless}z{\textless}0.6 using the F2 field of the SHELS complete galaxy redshift survey. We show, for the first time, that while the [OIII]/Hb and [OIII]/[OII] ratios rise, the [NII]/H-alpha and [SII]/H-alpha ratios fall significantly over the 0.2{\textless}z{\textless}0.35 redshift range for stellar masses between 9.2{\textless}log(M/Msun){\textless}10.6.

We conclusively rule out AGN contamination, a changing ISM pressure, and a change in the hardness of the EUV radiation field as the cause of the change in the line ratios between 0.2{\textless}z{\textless}0.35. We find that the ionization parameter rises significantly with redshift (by 0.1 to 0.25 dex depending on the stellar mass of the sample). We show that the ionization parameter is strongly correlated with the fraction of young-to-old stars, as traced by the H-beta equivalent width. We discuss the implications of this result on higher redshift studies, and we consider the implications on the use of standard optical metallicity diagnostics at high redshift.},

abstract = {We present the emission-line fluxes and kinematics of 48 representative elliptical and lenticular galaxies obtained with our custom-built integral-field spectrograph SAURON. Hb, [OIII], and [NI] emission lines were measured using a new procedure that simultaneously fits both the stellar spectrum and the emission lines. Using this technique we can detect emission lines down to an equivalent width of 0.1A set by the current limitations in describing galaxy spectra with synthetic and real stellar templates, rather than by the quality of our spectra. Emission is detected in 75{\%} of our sample galaxies, and comes in a variety of resolved spatial distributions and kinematic behaviours. The ionised-gas kinematics is rarely consistent with simple coplanar circular motions. However, the gas almost never displays completely irregular kinematics, generally showing coherent motions with smooth variations in angular momentum. In the majority of the cases the gas kinematics is decoupled from the stellar kinematics, and in half of the objects this decoupling implies a recent acquisition of gaseous material. Over the entire sample however, the distribution of the mean misalignment values between stellar and gaseous angular momenta is inconsistent with a purely external origin. Consistent with previous studies, the presence of dust features is always accompanied by gas emission while the converse is not always true. A considerable range of values for the [OIII]/Hb ratio is found both across the sample and within single galaxies. Despite the limitations of this ratio as an emission-line diagnostic, this finding suggests either that a variety of mechanisms is responsible for the gas excitation in E and S0 galaxies or that the metallicity of the interstellar material is quite heterogeneous.},

Using Parkes data we find evidence of additional extended, low-column-density HI emission around IC 5270, indicating that the clouds are the tip of the iceberg of a larger system of gas surrounding this galaxy. This result adds to the body of evidence on the presence of intra-group gas within the IC 1459 group. Altogether, the HI found outside galaxies in this group amounts to several times {\$}10{\^{}}9{\$} M{\$}{\_}\backslashodot{\$}, at least 10{\%} of the HI contained inside galaxies. This suggests a substantial flow of gas in and out of galaxies during the several billion years of the group's evolution.},

abstract = {Context: As more and more data are collected by cosmic ray experiments such as the Pierre Auger Observatory and Telescope Array (TA), the search for the sources of the Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR) continues. Already we have some hints about the sources or type of sources involved and more work is required to confirm any of this. Aims: We intend to predict the UHECR fluxes and the maximal energies of particles from two complete samples of nearby active galaxies, selected at radio and far-infrared frequencies. Also, we investigate the magnetic scattering of the UHECR path in the intervening cosmic space. Methods: We propose here a new method of searching for the sources of the UHECR in three steps, first we model the activity of the type of sources and get the flux of UHECR and a maximal energy for particle acceleration, then we model the interaction and angle deflection in the intergalactic space and finally we simulate the distribution of the cosmic rays events that can be statistically compared with future data of the cosmic rays observatories. Results: We analyzed two classes of sources, gamma ray bursts (GRBs) and Radio Galaxies (RGs). Ordering by the UHECR flux, few RGs are viable candidates, as for GRB many sources are viable candidates, requiring less scattering of the particles along their path to Earth to interpret the presently observed sky distribution. Most of the flux from RGs comes from the Southern sky, and most of the flux of particles from GRB comes from the North, although the differences are so small as to require large statistics to confirm this. The intergalactic and Galactic magnetic fields may help to distinguish the two extreme cases, also pure protons from heavy nuclei at the same energy. As a consequence flat spectrum radio sources such as 3C279 should confirm the production of UHECR in this class of sources through energetic neutrinos.},

abstract = {We have obtained long-slit spectroscopy for a sample of 9 S0 galaxies in the Fornax Cluster using the FORS2 spectrograph at the 8.2m ESO VLT. From these data, we have extracted the kinematic parameters, comprising the mean velocity, velocity dispersion and higher-moment H3 and H4 coefficients, as a function of position along the major axes of these galaxies. Comparison with published kinematics indicates that earlier data are often limited by their lower signal-to-noise ratio and relatively poor spectral resolution. The greater depth and higher dispersion of the new data mean that we reach well beyond the bulges of these systems, probing their disk kinematics in some detail for the first time. Qualitative inspection of the results for individual galaxies shows that they are not entirely simple systems, perhaps indicating a turbulent past. Nonetheless, we are able to derive reliable circular velocities for most of these systems, which points the way toward a study of their Tully-Fisher relation. This study, along with an analysis of the stellar populations of these systems out to large galactocentric distances, will form the bases of future papers exploiting these new high-quality data, hopefully shedding new light on the evolutionary history of these systems.},

This demonstrates that dynamical friction alone cannot be responsible for the differing distributions of slow and fast rotators. For dynamical friction to play a significant role, slow rotators must reside in higher mass sub-haloes than fast rotators and/or form in the centres of groups before being accreted on to the cluster.},

abstract = {(abridged) The Pierre Auger Collaboration has reported 27 Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Ray Events (UHECRs) with energies above 56 EeV and well determined arrival directions as of 2007 August 31. They find that the arrival directions are not isotropic, but instead appear correlated with the positions of nearby AGNs. Our aim was to determine the sources of these UHECRs by comparing their arrival directions with more comprehensive source catalogs.   Four (eight) of the 27 UHECRs with energy {\textgreater}56EeV detected by the Pierre Auger Observatory have arrival directions within 1.5deg (3.5deg) of the extended ({\textgreater}180kpc) radio structures of nearby radiogalaxies or the single nearby BLLac with extended radio structure. Conversely the radio structures of three (six) of all ten nearest extended radiogalaxies are within 1.5deg (3.5deg) of a UHECR; three of the remaining four radiogalaxies are in directions with lower exposure times. This correlation between nearby extended radiogalaxies and a subset of UHECRs is significant at the 99.9{\%} level. This is the first direct observational proof that radio galaxies are a significant source of UHECRs. For the remaining {\~{}}20 UHECRs, an isotropic distribution cannot be ruled out at high significance. The correlation found by the Auger Collaboration between the 27 UHECRs and AGNs in the Veron-Cetty {\&} Veron catalog at D {\textless} 71Mpc has a much lower significance when one considers only the {\~{}}20 UHECRs not `matched' to nearby extended radiogalaxies. No correlation is seen between UHECRs and supernovae, supernova remnants, nearby galaxies, or nearby groups and clusters of galaxies. The primary difference between the UHECR detections at the Pierre Auger Observatory and previous experiments may thus be that the Southern Hemisphere is more privileged with respect to nearby extended radiogalaxies.},

abstract = {We present results from Chandra X-ray imaging and spectroscopy of a flux-limited sample of flat spectrum radio-emitting quasars with jet-like extended structure. Twelve of twenty quasar jets are detected in 5 ks ACIS-S exposures. The quasars without X-ray jets are not significantly different from those in the sample with detected jets except that the extended radio emission is generally fainter. New radio maps are combined with the X-ray images in order to elucidate the relation between radio and X-ray emission in spatially resolved structures. We find a variety of morphologies, including long straight jets and bends up to 90 degrees. All X-ray jets are one-sided although the radio images used for source selection often show lobes opposite the X-ray jets. The FR II X-ray jets can all be interpreted as inverse Compton scattering of cosmic microwave background photons by electrons in large-scale relativistic jets although deeper observations are required to test this interpretation in detail. Applying this interpretation to the jets as a population, we find that the jets would be aligned to within 30 degrees of the line of sight generally, assuming that the bulk Lorentz factor of the jets is 10.},

abstract = {This paper is the third one in a series, intended to investigate how the observed kinematics of elliptical galaxies are affected by dust attenuation. In Paper I and Paper II, we investigated the effects of dust absorption; here we extend our modelling in order to include the effects of scattering. We describe how kinematical information can be combined with the radiative transfer equation, and present a Monte Carlo code that can handle kinematical information in an elegant way.   Compared to the case where only absorption is taken into account, we find that dust attenuation considerably affects the observed kinematics when scattering is included. For the central lines of sight, dust can either decrease or increase the central observed velocity dispersion. The most important effect of dust attenuation, however, is found at large projected radii. The kinematics at these lines of sight are strongly affected by photons scattered into these lines of sight, which were emitted by high-velocity stars in the central regions of the galaxy. These photons bias the LOSVDs towards high line-of-sight velocities, and significantly increase the observed velocity dispersion and LOSVD shape parameters. These effects are similar to the expected kinematical signature of a dark matter halo, such that dust attenuation may form an alternative explanation for the usual stellar kinematical evidence for dark matter halos around elliptical galaxies.   We apply our results to discuss several other topics in galactic dynamics, where we feel dust attenuation should be taken into account. In particular, we argue that the kinematics observed at various wavelengths can help to constrain the spatial distribution of dust in elliptical galaxies.},

abstract = {(Ultra)Luminous Infrared Galaxies [(U)LIRGs] are much more numerous at cosmological distances than locally, and are likely precursors of elliptical galaxies. Our goal is to carry out an integral field spectroscopic survey of a representative sample of low redshift (z {\textless} 0.26) (U)LIRGs, covering different morphologies from spirals to mergers over the entire infrared luminosity range. The present study is based on optical IFS obtained with the VIMOS instrument on the VLT. The first results of this survey are presented here with the study of two galaxies representative of the two major morphological types observed in (U)LIRGs, interacting pairs and morphologically- regular, weakly-interacting spirals, respectively. We have found that IRAS 06076-2139 consists of two low-intermediate mass (0.15 and 0.4 m*) galaxies with relative velocities of {\~{}} 550 km/s and, therefore, it is unlikely that they will merge. The VIMOS IFS has also discovered the presence of a rapidly expanding and rotating ring of gas in the southern galaxy (Gs), likely due to a nearly central head-on passage of an intruder about 140 million years ago. IRASF 12115-4656 is a spiral for which we have found a mass of 1.2 m*. The neutral gas (traced by the NaI doublet) and ionized gas components are spatially and kinematically decoupled. The analysis presented here illustrates the full potential of IFS in two important aspects: (i) the study of the kinematics and ionization structure of complex interacting/merging systems, and (2i) the study of the kinematics of the different gas phases, neutral (cool) and ionized (warm), traced by the NaD and Halpha lines, respectively.

Continuum and background subtracted emission line maps in the light of [O III] 5007, H-alpha, and [N II] 6584 are presented. Both galaxies display signs of ongoing perturbation and/or interaction. UM 420 is resolved for the first time to be a merging system composed of two starbursting components with an 'arm-like' structure associated with the largest component. UM 462 which is a disrupted system of irregular morphology is resolved into at least four starbursting regions. Maps of the H-alpha radial velocity and FWHM are discussed. No underlying broad line region was detected from either galaxy as the emission lines are well-fitted with single Gaussian profiles only. Electron temperatures and densities as well as the abundances of helium, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulphur were computed from spectra integrated over the whole galaxies and for each area of recent star formation. Maps of the O/H ratio are presented: these galaxies show oxygen abundances that are {\~{}}20 per cent solar. No evidence of substantial abundance variations across the galaxies that would point to significant nitrogen or oxygen self-enrichment is found ({\textless}0.2 dex limit). Contrary to previous observations, this analysis does not support the classification of these BCGs as Wolf-Rayet galaxies as the characteristic broad emission line features have not been detected in our spectra. Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich emission line ratio diagrams which were constructed on a pixel by pixel basis indicate that the optical spectra of these systems are predominantly excited by stellar photoionization.},

abstract = {We present deep Keck/LRIS spectroscopy and Hubble Space Telescope/WFC3 imaging in the rest-frame optical for a sample of eight galaxies at z {\~{}} 1.5 with high photometrically determined stellar masses. The data are combined with five Very Large Telescope/X-Shooter spectra. We find that these 13 galaxies have high velocity dispersions, with a median of $\sigma$ = 301 km s-1. This high value is consistent with their relatively high stellar masses and compact sizes. We study their stellar populations using the strength of Balmer absorption lines, which are not sensitive to dust absorption. We find a large range in Balmer absorption strength, with many galaxies showing very strong lines indicating young ages. The median H$\delta$A equivalent width, determined directly or inferred from the H10 line, is 5.4 {\AA}, indicating a luminosity-weighted age of {\~{}}1 Gyr. Although this value may be biased toward higher values because of selection effects, high-dispersion galaxies with such young ages are extremely rare in the local universe. Interestingly, we do not find a simple correlation with rest-frame U - V color: some of the reddest galaxies have very strong Balmer absorption lines, which may indicate the importance of multiple bursts of star formation. These results demonstrate that many high-dispersion galaxies at z {\~{}} 1.5 were recently quenched. This implies that there must be a population of star-forming progenitors at z {\~{}} 2 with high velocity dispersions or linewidths, which are notoriously absent from CO/H$\alpha$ selected surveys.},

We combine these measurements to infer velocity dispersions and determine how the number density of galaxies at fixed inferred dispersion, or the velocity dispersion function (VDF), evolves with time for each population. We show that the number of galaxies with high velocity dispersions appears to be surprisingly stable with time, regardless of their star formation history. Furthermore, the overall VDF for star-forming galaxies is constant with redshift, extending down to the lowest velocity dispersions probed by this study. The only galaxy population showing strong evolution are quiescent galaxies with low inferred dispersions, whose number density increases by a factor of {\~{}}4 since z = 1.5. This buildup leads to an evolution in the quiescent fraction of galaxies such that the threshold dispersion above which quiescent galaxies dominate the counts moves to lower velocity dispersion with time. We show that our results are qualitatively consistent with a simple model in which star-forming galaxies quench and are added to the quiescent population. In order to compensate for the migration into the quiescent population, the velocity dispersions of star-forming galaxies must increase, with a rate that increases with dispersion.},

abstract = {Observations of galaxy isophotes, longs-slit kinematics and high-resolution photometry suggested a possible dichotomy between two distinct classes of E galaxies. But these methods are expensive for large galaxy samples. Instead, integral-field spectroscopic can efficiently recognize the shape, dynamics and stellar population of complete samples of early-type galaxies (ETGs). These studies showed that the two main classes, the fast and slow rotators, can be separated using stellar kinematics. We showed there is a dichotomy in the dynamics of the two classes. The slow rotators are weakly triaxial and dominate above {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm crit{\}}\backslashapprox2\backslashtimes10{\^{}}{\{}11{\}} M{\_}\backslashodot{\$}. Below {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm crit{\}}{\$}, the structure of fast rotators parallels that of spiral galaxies. There is a smooth sequence along which, the metals content, the enhancement in {\$}\backslashalpha{\$}-elements, and the "weight" of the stellar initial mass function, all increase with the CENTRAL mass density slope, or bulge mass fraction, while the molecular gas fraction correspondingly decreases. The properties of ETGs on galaxy scaling relations, and in particular the {\$}(M{\_}{\{}\backslashast{\}}, R{\_}{\{}\backslashrm e{\}}){\$} diagram, and their dependence on environment, indicate two main independent channels for galaxy evolution. Fast rotators ETGs start as star forming disks and evolve trough a channel dominated by gas accretion, bulge growth and quenching. While slow rotators assemble near the center of massive halos via intense star formation at high redshift, and remain as such for the rest of their evolution via a channel dominated by gas poor mergers. This is consistent with independent studies of the galaxies redshift evolution.},

abstract = {Are the FRI and FRII radio galaxies representative of the radio-loud (RL) AGN population in the local Universe? Recent studies on the local low-luminosity radio sources cast lights on an emerging population of compact radio galaxies which lack extended radio emission. In a pilot JVLA project, we study the high-resolution images of a small but representative sample of this population. The radio maps reveal compact unresolved or slightly resolved radio structures on a scale of 1-3 kpc. We find that these RL AGN live in red massive early-type galaxies, with large black hole masses ({\$}\backslashgtrsim{\$}10{\$}{\^{}}{\{}8{\}}{\$} M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}), and spectroscopically classified as Low Excitation Galaxies, all characteristics typical of FRI radio galaxies which they also share the same nuclear luminosity with. However, they are more core dominated (by a factor of {\$}\backslashsim{\$}30) than FRIs and show a clear deficit of extended radio emission. We call these sources 'FR0' to emphasize their lack of prominent extended radio emission. A posteriori, other compact radio sources found in the literature fulfill the requirements for a FR0 classification. Hence, the emerging FR0 population appears to be the dominant radio class of the local Universe. Considering their properties we speculate on their possible origins and the possible cosmological scenarios they imply.},

These MASSIVE ETGs seem to have lower star-formation efficiencies (SFE=SFR/M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashrm H2{\}}{\$}) than spiral galaxies, but the SFEs derived are consistent with being drawn from the same distribution found in other lower mass ETG samples. This suggests that the SFE is not simply a function of stellar mass, but that local, internal processes are more important for regulating star formation. Finally we used the CO line profiles to investigate the high-mass end of the Tully-Fisher relation (TFR). We find that there is a break in the slope of the TFR for ETGs at high masses (consistent with previous studies). The strength of this break correlates with the stellar velocity dispersion of the host galaxies, suggesting it is caused by additional baryonic mass being present in the centre of massive ETGs. We speculate on the root cause of this change and its implications for galaxy formation theories.},

abstract = {Context. Powerful radio-AGN are hosted by massive elliptical galaxies that are usually very poor in molecular gas. Nevertheless, gas is needed at their very center to feed the nuclear activity.  Aims: We study the molecular gas properties (i.e., mass, kinematics, distribution, origin) of these objects, and compare them with results for other known samples.  Methods: At the IRAM-30m telescope, we performed a survey of the CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) emission from the most powerful radio galaxies of the Local Universe, selected only on the basis of their radio continuum fluxes.  Results: The main result of our survey is that the molecular gas content of these galaxies is very low compared to spiral or FIR-selected galaxies. The median value of the molecular gas mass, including detections and upper limits, is 2.2 × 108 M⊙. When separated into FR-I and FR-II types, a difference in their H2 masses is found. The median value of FR-I galaxies is about 1.9 × 108 M⊙ and higher for FR-II galaxies, at about 4.5 × 108 M⊙. Which is probably entirely because of a Malmquist bias. Our results contrast with those of previous surveys, whose targets were mainly selected by means of their FIR emission, implying that we measure higher observed masses of molecular gas. Moreover, the shape of CO spectra suggest that a central molecular gas disk exists in 30{\%} of these radio galaxies, a lower rate than in other active galaxy samples.  Conclusions: We find a low level of molecular gas in our sample of radio-selected AGNs, indicating that galaxies do not need much molecular gas to host an AGN. The presence of a molecular gas disk in some galaxies and the wide range of molecular gas masses may be indicative of different origins for the gas, which we can not exclude at present (e.g., minor/major mergers, stellar mass loss, or accretion).

abstract = {Classical double-lobed radio galaxies are hosted almost exclusively by elliptical galaxies that otherwise resemble normal elliptical galaxies in both their global stellar distribution and kinematics. Given that normal elliptical galaxies usually contain undetectable quantities of neutral gas, what fuels the AGN in powerful elliptical radio galaxies? Here, we present results of a search for molecular gas in radio galaxies at z {\textless} 0.031 selected from the revised 3C catalog, comprising the most powerful radio galaxies in the Local Universe. We detected 4 of the 22 galaxies observed, with molecular gas masses ranging from about 107 - 109 Msun; the remaining galaxies were not detected at a typical upper limit of about 108 Msun. We argue that this molecular gas most likely originates from the cannibalism of secondary gas-rich galaxies by the parent elliptical galaxy, rather than the merger of two gas-rich galaxies that spawned a remnant elliptical galaxy.  All the galaxies detected possess central dust disks or lanes, and exhibit very broad double-horned line profiles characteristic of a rapidly-rotating disk with an inner depression. We suggest that this molecular-gas disk comprises the gas reservoir for fueling the central supermassive black hole.  Finally, we present preliminary results of a follow-up survey to better understand the mass distribution of molecular gas in powerful radio galaxies. The results thus far show that an increasing number of radio galaxies become detectable in molecular gas at lower mass limits, suggesting a broad (at least 3 orders of magnitude) distribution of molecular gas masses in powerful radio galaxies.},

Our high-resolution (1.9"×1.4", or 640pc×470pc, at D=70 Mpc) 12CO image shows a circularly rotating molecular gas disk that closely coincides with a silhouette disk observed in the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) optical images.

The rotation velocity of the disk is 460 km s-1 at a radius of 1 kpc, giving an enclosed mass (dynamical mass) of Mdyn=5.0×1010Msolar within this radius. The ratio of gas mass to dynamical mass, Mgas/Mdyn, is less than 0.02, indicating that the gas disk at the center of 3C 31 is stable against gravitational instabilities, although the total gas mass of the nuclear disk in 3C 31 is fairly large compared with the nuclear gas concentration observed in late-type spirals.},

abstract = {We use hydrodynamical simulations to study the color transformations induced by star formation and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) during major mergers of spiral galaxies. Our modeling accounts for radiative cooling, star formation, and supernova feedback. Moreover, we include a treatment of accretion onto supermassive black holes embedded in the nuclei of the merging galaxies. We assume that a small fraction of the bolometric luminosity of an accreting black hole couples thermally to surrounding gas, providing a feedback mechanism that regulates its growth. The encounter and coalescence of the galaxies triggers nuclear gas inflow, which fuels both a powerful starburst and strong black hole accretion. Comparing simulations with and without black holes, we show that AGN feedback can quench star formation and accretion on a short timescale, particularly in large galaxies where the black holes can drive powerful winds once they become sufficiently massive. The color evolution of the remnant differs markedly between mergers with and without central black holes. Without AGNs, gas-rich mergers lead to elliptical galaxies that remain blue owing to residual star formation, even after more than 7 Gyr have elapsed. In contrast, mergers with black holes produce elliptical galaxies that redden much faster, an effect that is more pronounced in massive remnants where a nearly complete termination of star formation occurs, allowing them to redden to u-r{\~{}}=2.3 in less than 1 Gyr. AGN feedback may thus be required to explain the population of extremely red massive early-type galaxies, and it appears to be an important driver in generating the observed bimodal color distribution of galaxies in the local universe.},

We present an analysis of the dust features, which are often present in the form of circum-nuclear disks or lanes, and show that there are correlations between radio source and dust properties. It is found that nearby radio sources in which a jet has been detected tend to have dust more often than sources without jets; the dust is often in the form of disks or lanes. Moreover the radio jets are close to perpendicular to the disk or lane in the weaker radio sources (with P {\textless} 1024 WHz-1). In stronger sources the orientation effect appears to be weak or even absent. Also the dust masses found in the weaker radio sources are smaller than in the stronger ones (log M/Msun  {\~{}} 3 against 5 respectively). More generally it appears that there is a correlation between dust mass and total radio power (for those sources in which dust has been detected); we show that this correlation is not induced by redshift.

In another recent paper, Allen et al. have shown that Bondi accretion of the hot, X-ray emitting phase of the intergalactic medium (IGM) is sufficient to power the jets of several nearby, low-power radio galaxies at the centres of clusters. In this paper, we combine these ideas and suggest that accretion of the hot phase of the IGM is sufficient to power all low-excitation radio sources, while high-excitation sources are powered by accretion of cold gas that is in general unrelated to the hot IGM. This model explains a number of properties of the radio-loud active galaxy population, and has important implications for the energy input of radio-loud active galactic nuclei into the hot phase of the IGM: the energy supply of powerful high-excitation sources does not have a direct connection to the hot phase.},

We find that the rest-frame color distribution of these galaxies is bimodal at all redshifts out to z{\~{}}1. This bimodality permits a model-independent definition of red early-type galaxies and blue late-type galaxies at any given redshift. The colors of the blue peak become redder toward the present day, and the number density of blue luminous galaxies has dropped strongly since z{\~{}}1. Focusing on the red galaxies, we find that they populate a color-magnitude relation. Such red sequences have been identified in galaxy cluster environments, but our data show that such a sequence exists over this redshift range even when averaging over all environments. The mean color of the red galaxy sequence evolves with redshift in a way that is consistent with the aging of an ancient stellar population. The rest-frame B-band luminosity density in red galaxies evolves only mildly with redshift in a $\Lambda$-dominated cold dark matter universe. When we account for the change in stellar mass-to-light ratio implied by the redshift evolution in red galaxy colors, the COMBO-17 data indicate an increase in stellar mass on the red sequence by a factor of 2 since z{\~{}}1. The largest source of uncertainty is large-scale structure, implying that considerably larger surveys are necessary to further refine this result. We explore mechanisms that may drive this evolution in the red galaxy population, finding that both galaxy merging and truncation of star formation in some fraction of the blue star-forming population are required to fully explain the properties of these galaxies.},

We describe changes to the information in the database since earlier interim data releases. Future releases will include velocity dispersions, distances and peculiar velocities for the brightest early-type galaxies, comprising about 10{\%} of the sample. Here we provide redshift maps of the southern local universe with z{\textless}=0.1, showing nearby large-scale structures in hitherto unseen detail.

abstract = {[Abridged] Detecting cosmic ray hits (cosmics) in fiber-fed IFS data of single exposures is a challenging task, because of the complex signal recorded by IFS instruments. Existing detection algorithms are commonly found to be unreliable in the case of IFS data and the optimal parameter settings are usually unknown a-priori for a given dataset. The CALIFA survey generates hundreds of IFS datasets for which a reliable and robust detection algorithm for cosmics is required as an important part of the fully automatic CALIFA data reduction pipeline. We developed a novel algorithm, PyCosmic, which combines the edge-detection algorithm of L.A.Cosmic with a point-spread function convolution scheme. We generated mock data to compute the efficiency of different algorithms for a wide range of characteristic fibre-fed IFS datasets using the PMAS and VIMOS IFS instruments as representative cases. PyCosmic is the only algorithm that achieves an acceptable detection performance for CALIFA data. We find that PyCosmic is the most robust tool with a detection rate of {\textgreater}{\~{}}90{\%} and a false detection rate {\textless}5{\%} for any of the tested IFS data. It has one less free parameter than the L.A.Cosmic algorithm. Only for strongly undersampled IFS data does L.A.Cosmic exceed the performance of PyCosmic by a few per cent. DCR never reaches the efficiency of the other two algorithms and should only be used if computational speed is a concern. Thus, PyCosmic appears to be the most versatile cosmics detection algorithm for IFS data. It is implemented in the new CALIFA data reduction pipeline as well as in recent versions of the multi-instrument IFS pipeline P3D.},

New Hubble Space Telescope imaging of far-ultraviolet continuum emission from young ([lsim]10 Myr), massive ({\{}gtrsim{\}}5 M{\{}odot{\}}) stars reveals filamentary and clumpy morphologies, which we quantify by means of structural indices. The FUV data are compared with X-ray, Ly, narrow-band H, broad-band optical/IR, and radio maps, providing a high spatial resolution atlas of star formation locales relative to the ambient hot ([{\~{}}]107-8 K) and warm ionized ([{\~{}}]104 K) gas phases, as well as the old stellar population and radio-bright active galactic nucleus (AGN) outflows. Nearly half of the sample possesses kpc-scale filaments that, in projection, extend towards and around radio lobes and/or X-ray cavities. These filaments may have been uplifted by the propagating jet or buoyant X-ray bubble, or may have formed in situ by cloud collapse at the interface of a radio lobe or rapid cooling in a cavity's compressed shell. The morphological diversity of nearly the entire FUV sample is reproduced by recent hydrodynamical simulations in which the AGN powers a self-regulating rain of thermally unstable star-forming clouds that precipitate from the hot atmosphere. In this model, precipitation triggers where the cooling-to-free-fall time ratio is tcool/tff [{\~{}}] 10. This condition is roughly met at the maximal projected FUV radius for more than half of our sample, and clustering about this ratio is stronger for sources with higher star formation rates.},

abstract = {Brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) are usually quiescent, but many exhibit star formation. Here we exploit the opportunity provided by rest-frame UV imaging of galaxy clusters in the Cluster Lensing and Supernovae with Hubble (CLASH) Multi-Cycle Treasury Project to reveal the diversity of UV morphologies in BCGs and to compare them with recent simulations of the cool, star-forming gas structures produced by precipitation-driven feedback. All of the CLASH BCGs are detected in the rest-frame UV (280 nm), regardless of their star formation activity, because evolved stellar populations produce a modest amount of UV light that traces the relatively smooth, symmetric, and centrally peaked stellar distribution seen in the near infrared. Ultraviolet morphologies among the BCGs with strong UV excesses exhibit distinctive knots, multiple elongated clumps, and extended filaments of emission that distinctly differ from the smooth profiles of the UV-quiet BCGs. These structures, which are similar to those seen in the few star-forming BCGs observed in the UV at low redshift, are suggestive of bi-polar streams of clumpy star formation, but not of spiral arms or large, kiloparsec-scale disks. Based on the number of streams and lack of culprit companion galaxies, these streams are unlikely to have arisen from multiple collisions with gas-rich galaxies. These star-forming UV structures are morphologically similar to the cold-gas structures produced in simulations of precipitation-driven active galactic nucleus feedback in which jets uplift low-entropy gas to greater altitudes, causing it to condense. Unobscured star formation rates estimated from CLASH UV images using the Kennicutt relation range up to 80  in the most extended and highly structured systems. The circumgalactic gas-entropy threshold for star formation in CLASH BCGs at  0.2–0.5 is indistinguishable from that for clusters at .},

Equations governing stationary force-free electromagnetic fields in Kerr spacetime are derived, and it is found that energy and angular momentum can be extracted from a rotating black hole by a purely electromagnetic mechanism. A perturbation technique is outlined for calculating approximate solutions under certain circumstances, and solutions are obtained for a split monopole magnetic field as well as for a paraboloidal magnetic field. The present concepts are applied to a model of an active galactic nucleus containing a massive black hole surrounded by an accretion disk.},

abstract = {Aims: We present photometric properties and distance measurements of 252 high redshift Type Ia supernovae (0.15 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.1) discovered during the first three years of the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS). These events were detected and their multi-colour light curves measured using the MegaPrime/MegaCam instrument at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT), by repeatedly imaging four one-square degree fields in four bands. Follow-up spectroscopy was performed at the VLT, Gemini and Keck telescopes to confirm the nature of the supernovae and to measure their redshifts.  Methods: Systematic uncertainties arising from light curve modeling are studied, making use of two techniques to derive the peak magnitude, shape and colour of the supernovae, and taking advantage of a precise calibration of the SNLS fields.  Results: A flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmological fit to 231 SNLS high redshift type Ia supernovae alone gives $\Omega${\_}M = 0.211 ± 0.034(stat) ± 0.069(sys). The dominant systematic uncertainty comes from uncertainties in the photometric calibration. Systematic uncertainties from light curve fitters come next with a total contribution of ±0.026 on $\Omega${\_}M. No clear evidence is found for a possible evolution of the slope ($\beta$) of the colour-luminosity relation with redshift.

abstract = {The ATLAS3D project is a multiwavelength survey combined with a theoretical modelling effort. The observations span from the radio to the millimetre and optical, and provide multicolour imaging, two-dimensional kinematics of the atomic (H I), molecular (CO) and ionized gas (H$\beta$, [O III] and [N I]), together with the kinematics and population of the stars (H$\beta$, Fe5015 and Mg b), for a carefully selected, volume-limited (1.16 × 105 Mpc3) sample of 260 early-type (elliptical E and lenticular S0) galaxies (ETGs). The models include semi-analytic, N-body binary mergers and cosmological simulations of galaxy formation. Here we present the science goals for the project and introduce the galaxy sample and the selection criteria. The sample consists of nearby (D {\textless} 42 Mpc, |$\delta$- 29°| {\textless} 35°, |b| {\textgreater} 15°) morphologically selected ETGs extracted from a parent sample of 871 galaxies (8 per cent E, 22 per cent S0 and 70 per cent spirals) brighter than MK {\textless} -21.5 mag (stellar mass M★≳ 6 ×109 M⊙). We analyse possible selection biases and we conclude that the parent sample is essentially complete and statistically representative of the nearby galaxy population. We present the size-luminosity relation for the spirals and ETGs and show that the ETGs in the ATLAS3D sample define a tight red sequence in a colour-magnitude diagram, with few objects in the transition from the blue cloud. We describe the strategy of the SAURON integral field observations and the extraction of the stellar kinematics with the pPXF method. We find typical 1$\sigma$ errors of $\Delta$V≈ 6 km s-1, $\Delta$$\sigma$≈ 7 km s-1, $\Delta$h3≈$\Delta$h4≈ 0.03 in the mean velocity, the velocity dispersion and Gauss-Hermite (GH) moments for galaxies with effective dispersion $\sigma$e≳ 120 km s-1. For galaxies with lower $\sigma$e (≈40 per cent of the sample) the GH moments are gradually penalized by pPXF towards zero to suppress the noise produced by the spectral undersampling and only V and $\sigma$ can be measured. We give an overview of the characteristics of the other main data sets already available for our sample and of the ongoing modelling projects.},

abstract = {We provide a census of the apparent stellar angular momentum within one effective radius of a volume-limited sample of 260 early-type galaxies (ETGs) in the nearby Universe, using the integral-field spectroscopy obtained in the course of the ATLAS3D project. We exploit the $\lambda$R parameter (previously used via a constant threshold value of 0.1) to characterize the existence of two families of ETGs: slow rotators which exhibit complex stellar velocity fields and often include stellar kinematically distinct cores, and fast rotators which have regular velocity fields. Our complete sample of 260 ETGs leads to a new criterion to disentangle fast and slow rotators which now includes a dependency on the apparent ellipticity ɛ. It separates the two classes significantly better than the previous prescription and better than a criterion based on V/$\sigma$: slow rotators and fast rotators have $\lambda$R lower and larger than ?, respectively, where kFS= 0.31 for measurements made within an effective radius Re.  We show that the vast majority of ETGs are fast rotators: these have the regular stellar rotation, with aligned photometric and kinematic axes (Paper II of this series), include discs and often bars and represent 86 ± 2 per cent (224/260) of all ETGs in the volume-limited ATLAS3D sample. Fast rotators span the full range of apparent ellipticities from ɛ= 0 to 0.85, and we suggest that they cover intrinsic ellipticities from about 0.35 to 0.85, the most flattened having morphologies consistent with spiral galaxies. Only a small fraction of ETGs are slow rotators representing 14 ± 2 per cent (36/260) of the ATLAS3D sample of ETGs. Of all slow rotators, 11 per cent (4/36) exhibit two counter-rotating stellar disc-like components and are rather low-mass objects (Mdyn {\textless} 1010.5 M⊙). All other slow rotators (32/36) appear relatively round on the sky (ɛe {\textless} 0.4), tend to be massive (Mdyn {\textgreater} 1010.5 M⊙), and often (17/32) exhibit kinematically distinct cores. Slow rotators dominate the high-mass end of ETGs in the ATLAS3D sample, with only about one-fourth of galaxies with masses above 1011.5 M⊙ being fast rotators. We show that the a4 parameter which quantifies the isophote's disciness or boxiness does not seem to be simply related to the observed kinematics, while our new criterion based on $\lambda$R and ɛ is nearly independent of the viewing angles. We further demonstrate that the classification of ETGs into ellipticals and lenticulars is misleading. Slow and fast rotators tend to be classified as ellipticals and lenticulars, respectively, but the contamination is strong enough to affect results solely based on such a scheme: 20 per cent of all fast rotators are classified as ellipticals, and more importantly 66 per cent of all ellipticals in the ATLAS3D sample are fast rotators.  Fast and slow rotators illustrate the variety of complex processes shaping galactic systems, such as secular evolution, disc instabilities, interaction and merging, gas accretion, stripping and harassment, forming a sequence from high to low (stellar) baryonic angular momentum. Massive slow rotators represent the extreme instances within the red sequence of galaxies which might have suffered from significant merging without being able to rebuild a fast-rotating component within one effective radius. We therefore argue for a shift in the paradigm for ETGs, where the vast majority of ETGs are galaxies consistent with nearly oblate systems (with or without bars) and where only a small fraction of them (less than 12 per cent) have central (mildly) triaxial structures.},

abstract = {We have carried out a survey for CO J= 1-0 and J= 2-1 emission in the 260 early-type galaxies of the volume-limited ATLAS3D sample, with the goal of connecting their star formation and assembly histories to their cold gas content. This is the largest volume-limited CO survey of its kind and is the first to include many Virgo cluster members. Sample members are dynamically hot galaxies with a median stellar mass ˜3 × 1010 M⊙; they are selected by their morphology rather than colour, and the bulk of them lie on the red sequence. The overall CO detection rate is 56/259 = 0.22 ± 0.03, with no dependence on the K luminosity and only a modest dependence on the dynamical mass. There are a dozen CO detections among the Virgo cluster members; statistical analysis of their H2 mass distributions and their dynamical status within the cluster shows that the cluster's influence on their molecular masses is subtle at best, even though (unlike spirals) they seem to be virialized within the cluster. We suggest that the cluster members have retained their molecular gas through several Gyr residences in the cluster. There are also a few extremely CO-rich early-type galaxies with H2 masses ≳109 M⊙ and these are in low-density environments. We do find a significant trend between the molecular content and stellar specific angular momentum. The galaxies of low angular momentum also have low CO detection rates, suggesting that their formation processes were more effective at destroying the molecular gas or preventing its re-accretion. We speculate on the implications of these data for the formation of various subclasses of early-type galaxies. Based on observations carried out with the IRAM 30-m telescope.

abstract = {We demonstrate here using both single-dish and interferometric observations that CO molecules are an excellent kinematic tracer, even in high-mass galaxies, allowing us to investigate for the first time the CO Tully-Fisher relation (CO-TFR) of early-type galaxies. We compare the TFRs produced using both single-dish and interferometric data and various inclination estimation methods, and evaluate the use of the velocity profile shape as a criterion for selecting galaxies in which the molecular gas extends beyond the peak of the rotation curve. We show that the gradient and zero-point of the best-fitting relations are robust, independent of the velocity measure and inclination used, and agree with those of relations derived using stellar kinematics. We also show that the early-type CO-TFR is offset from the CO-TFR of spirals by 0.98 ± 0.22 mag at Ks band, in line with other results. The intrinsic scatter of the relation is found to be ≈0.4 mag, similar to the level found in the spiral galaxy population. Next-generation facilities such as the Large Millimeter Telescope and the Atacama Large Millimeter/Sub-millimeter Array should allow this technique to be used in higher redshift systems, providing a simple new tool to trace the mass-to-light ratio evolution of the most massive galaxies over cosmic time.},

abstract = {We use the ATLAS3D sample of 260 early-type galaxies to study the apparent kinematic misalignment angle, $\Psi$, defined as the angle between the photometric and kinematic major axes. We find that 71 per cent of nearby early-type galaxies are strictly aligned systems ($\Psi$≤ 5°), an additional 14 per cent have 5° {\textless} $\Psi$≤ 10° and 90 per cent of galaxies have $\Psi$≤ 15°. Taking into account measurement uncertainties, 90 per cent of galaxies can be considered aligned to better than 5°, suggesting that only a small fraction of early-type galaxies (˜10 per cent) are not consistent with the axisymmetry within the projected half-light radius. We identify morphological features such as bars and rings (30 per cent), dust structures (16 per cent), blue nuclear colours (6 per cent) and evidence of interactions (8 per cent) visible on ATLAS3D galaxies. We use KINEMETRY to analyse the mean velocity maps and separate galaxies into two broad types of regular and non-regular rotators. We find 82 per cent of regular rotators and 17 per cent of non-regular rotators, with two galaxies that we were not able to classify due to the poor data quality. The non-regular rotators are typically found in dense regions and are massive. We characterize the specific features in the mean velocity and velocity dispersion maps. The majority of galaxies do not have any specific features, but we highlight here the frequency of the kinematically distinct cores (7 per cent of galaxies) and the aligned double peaks in the velocity dispersion maps (4 per cent of galaxies). We separate galaxies into five kinematic groups based on the kinemetric features, which are then used to interpret the ($\Psi$-ɛ) diagram. Most of the galaxies that are misaligned have complex kinematics and are non-regular rotators. In addition, some show evidence of the interaction and might not be in equilibrium, while some are barred. While the trends are weak, there is a tendency that large values of $\Psi$ are found in galaxies at intermediate environmental densities and among the most massive galaxies in the sample. Taking into account the kinematic alignment and the kinemetric analysis, the majority of early-type galaxies have velocity maps more similar to that of the spiral discs than to that of the remnants of equal-mass mergers. We suggest that the most common formation mechanism for early-type galaxies preserves the axisymmetry of the disc progenitors and their general kinematic properties. Less commonly, the formation process results in a triaxial galaxy with much lower net angular momentum.},

abstract = {We study the formation of early-type galaxies (ETGs) through mergers with a sample of 70 high-resolution (softening length {\textless}60 pc and 12 × 106 particles) numerical simulations of binary mergers of disc galaxies (with 10 per cent of gas) and 16 simulations of ETG remergers. These simulations, designed to accompany observations and models conducted within the ATLAS3D project, encompass various mass ratios (from 1:1 to 6:1), initial conditions and orbital parameters. The progenitor disc galaxies are spiral-like with bulge-to-disc ratios typical of Sb and Sc galaxies and high central baryonic angular momentum. We find that binary mergers of disc galaxies with mass ratios of 3:1 and 6:1 are nearly always classified as fast rotators according to the ATLAS3D criterion (based on the $\lambda$R parameter - ATLAS3D Paper III): they preserve the structure of the input fast rotating spiral progenitors. They have intrinsic ellipticities larger than 0.5, cover intrinsic $\lambda$R values between 0.2 and 0.6, within the range of observed fast rotators. The distribution of the observed fastest rotators does in fact coincide with the distribution of our disc progenitors. Major disc mergers (mass ratios of 2:1 and 1:1) lead to both fast and slow rotators. Most of the fast rotators produced in major mergers have intermediate flattening, with ellipticities ɛ between 0.4 and 0.6. Most slow rotators formed in these binary disc mergers hold a stellar kinematically distinct core (KDC) in their ˜1-3 central kiloparsec: these KDCs are built from the stellar components of the progenitors. However, these remnants are still very flat with ɛ often larger than 0.45 and sometimes as high as 0.65. Besides a handful of specific observed systems - the counter-rotating discs (2$\sigma$ galaxies, ATLAS3D Paper II) - these therefore cannot reproduce the observed population of slow rotators in the nearby Universe. This sample of simulations supports the notion of slow and fast rotators: these two families of ETGs present distinct characteristics in term of their angular momentum content (at all radii) and intrinsic properties - the slow rotators are not simply velocity-scaled down versions of fast rotators. The mass ratio of the progenitors is a fundamental parameter for the formation of slow rotators in these binary mergers, but it also requires a retrograde spin for the earlier-type (Sb) progenitor galaxy with respect to the orbital angular momentum. We also study remergers of these merger remnants: these produce relatively round fast rotators or systems near the threshold for slow rotators. In such cases, the orbital angular momentum dominates the central region, and these systems no longer exhibit a KDC, as KDCs are destroyed during the remergers and do not re-form in these relatively dry events.},

@article{Cappellari2011a,
abstract = {In Paper I of this series we introduced a volume-limited parent sample of 871 galaxies from which we extracted the ATLAS3D sample of 260 early-type galaxies (ETGs). In Papers II and III we classified the ETGs using their stellar kinematics, in a way that is nearly insensitive to the projection effects, and we separated them into fast and slow rotators. Here we look at galaxy morphology and note that the edge-on fast rotators generally are lenticular galaxies. They appear like spiral galaxies with the gas and dust removed, and in some cases are flat ellipticals (E5 or flatter) with discy isophotes. Fast rotators are often barred and span the same full range of bulge fractions as spiral galaxies. The slow rotators are rounder (E4 or rounder, except for counter-rotating discs) and are generally consistent with being genuine, namely spheroidal-like, elliptical galaxies. We propose a revision to the tuning-fork diagram by Hubble as it gives a misleading description of ETGs by ignoring the large variation in the bulge sizes of fast rotators. Motivated by the fact that only one third (34 per cent) of the ellipticals in our sample are slow rotators, we study for the first time the kinematic morphology-density T-$\Sigma$ relation using fast and slow rotators to replace lenticulars and ellipticals. We find that our relation is cleaner than using classic morphology. Slow rotators are nearly absent at the lowest density environments [? per cent] and generally constitute a small fraction [f(SR) ≈ 4 per cent] of the total galaxy population in the relatively low-density environments explored by our survey, with the exception of the densest core of the Virgo cluster [f(SR) ≈ 20 per cent]. This contrasts with the classic studies that invariably find significant fractions of (misclassified) ellipticals down to the lowest environmental densities. We find a clean log-linear relation between the fraction f(Sp) of spiral galaxies and the local galaxy surface density $\Sigma$3, within a cylinder enclosing the three nearest galaxies. This holds for nearly four orders of magnitude in the surface density down to $\Sigma$3≈ 0.01 Mpc-2, with f(Sp) decreasing by 10 per cent per dex in $\Sigma$3, while f(FR) correspondingly increases. The existence of a smooth kinematic T-$\Sigma$ relation in the field excludes processes related to the cluster environment, like e.g. ram-pressure stripping, as main contributors to the apparent conversion of spirals into fast rotators in low-density environments. It shows that the segregation is driven by local effects at the small-group scale. This is supported by the relation becoming shallower when using a surface density estimator $\Sigma$10 with a cluster scale. Only at the largest densities in the Virgo core does the f(Sp) relation break down and steepen sharply, while the fraction of slow rotators starts to significantly increase. This suggests that a different mechanism is at work there, possibly related to the stripping of the gas from spirals by the hot intergalactic medium in the cluster core and the corresponding lack of cold accretion.},

abstract = {We propose a simple model for the origin of fast and slow rotator early-type galaxies (ETG) within the hierarchical $\Lambda$cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) scenario, that is based on the assumption that the mass fraction of stellar discs in ETGs is a proxy for the specific angular momentum expressed via $\lambda$R. Within our model we reproduce the fraction of fast and slow rotators as a function of magnitude in the ATLAS3D survey, assuming that fast-rotating ETGs have at least 10 per cent of their total stellar mass in a disc component. In agreement with ATLAS3D observations we find that slow rotators are predominantly galaxies with M* {\textgreater} 1010.5 M⊙ contributing ˜20 per cent to the overall ETG population. We show in detail that the growth histories of fast and slow rotators are different, supporting the classification of ETGs into these two categories. Slow rotators accrete between ˜50 and 90 per cent of their stellar mass from satellites and their most massive progenitors have on average up to three major mergers during their evolution. Fast rotators in contrast accrete less than 50 per cent and have on average less than one major merger in their past.  We find that the underlying physical reason for the different growth histories is the slowing down and ultimately complete shut-down of gas cooling in massive galaxies. Once cooling and associated star formation in disc stop, galaxies grow via infall from satellites. Frequent minor mergers thereby destroy existing stellar discs via violent relaxation and also tend to lower the specific angular momentum of the main stellar body, lowering $\lambda$R into the slow rotator regime.  On average, the last gas-rich major merger interaction in slow rotators happens at z {\textgreater} 1.5, followed by a series of minor mergers. These results support the idea that kinematically decoupled cores (KDC) form during gas-rich major mergers at high z followed by minor mergers, which build-up the outer layers of the remnant, and make remnants that are initially too flat compared to observations become rounder. Fast rotators are less likely to form such KDCs due to the fact that they have on average less than one major merger in their past.  Fast rotators in our model have different formation paths. The majority, 78 per cent, has bulge-to-total stellar mass ratios (B/T) {\textgreater} 0.5 and managed to grow stellar discs due to continued gas cooling or bulges due to frequent minor mergers. The remaining 22 per cent live in high-density environments and consist of low B/T galaxies with gas fractions below 15 per cent, that have exhausted their cold gas reservoir and have no hot halo from which gas can cool. These fast rotators most likely resemble the flattened disc-like fast rotators in the ATLAS3D survey.  Our results predict that ETGs can change their state from fast to slow rotator and vice versa, while the former is taking place predominantly at low z (z {\textless} 2), the latter is occurring during cosmic epochs when cooling times are short and galaxies gas-rich. We predict that the ratio of the number density of slow to fast rotators is a strong function of redshift, with massive ({\textgreater}1010 M⊙) fast rotators being more than one order of magnitude more frequent at z˜ 2.},

abstract = {The mass assembly of galaxies leaves imprints in their outskirts, such as shells and tidal tails. The frequency and properties of such fine structures depend on the main acting mechanisms - secular evolution, minor or major mergers - and on the age of the last substantial accretion event. We use this to constrain the mass assembly history of two apparently relaxed nearby early-type galaxies (ETGs) selected from the ATLAS3D sample, NGC 680 and 5557. Our ultra-deep optical images obtained with MegaCam on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope reach 29 mag  arcsec-2 in the g band. They reveal very low surface brightness (LSB) filamentary structures around these ellipticals. Among them, a gigantic 160 kpc long, narrow, tail east of NGC 5557 hosts three gas-rich star-forming objects, previously detected in H I with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope and in UV with GALEX. NGC 680 exhibits two major diffuse plumes apparently connected to extended H I tails, as well as a series of arcs and shells. Comparing the outer stellar and gaseous morphology of the two ellipticals with that predicted from models of colliding galaxies, we argue that the LSB features are tidal debris and that each of these two ETGs was assembled during a relatively recent, major wet merger, which most likely occurred after the redshift z ≃ 0.5 epoch. Had these mergers been older, the tidal features should have already fallen back or be destroyed by more recent accretion events. However, the absence of molecular gas and of a prominent young stellar population in the core region of the galaxies indicates that the merger is at least 1-2 Gyr old: the memory of any merger-triggered nuclear starburst has indeed been lost. The star-forming objects found towards the collisional debris of NGC 5557 are then likely tidal dwarf galaxies. Such recycled galaxies here appear to be long-lived and continue to form stars while any star formation activity has stopped in their parent galaxy. The inner kinematics of NGC 680 is typical for fast rotators which make the bulk of nearby ETGs in the ATLAS3D sample. On the other hand, NGC 5557 belongs to the poorly populated class of massive, round, slow rotators that are predicted by semi-analytic models and cosmological simulations to be the end-product of a complex mass accretion history, involving ancient major mergers and more recent minor mergers. Our observations suggest that under specific circumstances a single binary merger may dominate the formation history of such objects and thus that at least some massive ETGs may form at relatively low redshift. Whether the two galaxies studied here are representative of their own sub-class of ETGs is still an open question that will be addressed by an on-going deep optical survey of ATLAS3D galaxies.},

abstract = {We make use of interferometric CO and H I observations, and optical integral-field spectroscopy from the ATLAS3D survey, to probe the origin of the molecular and ionized interstellar medium (ISM) in local early-type galaxies. We find that 36 ± 5 per cent of our sample of fast-rotating early-type galaxies have their ionized gas kinematically misaligned with respect to the stars, setting a strong lower limit on the importance of externally acquired gas (e.g. from mergers and cold accretion). Slow rotators have a flat distribution of misalignments, indicating that the dominant source of gas is external. The molecular, ionized and atomic gas in all the detected galaxies are always kinematically aligned, even when they are misaligned from the stars, suggesting that all these three phases of the ISM share a common origin. In addition, we find that the origin of the cold and warm gas in fast-rotating early-type galaxies is strongly affected by environment, despite the molecular gas detection rate and mass fractions being fairly independent of group/cluster membership. Galaxies in dense groups and the Virgo cluster nearly always have their molecular gas kinematically aligned with the stellar kinematics, consistent with a purely internal origin (presumably stellar mass loss). In the field, however, kinematic misalignments between the stellar and gaseous components indicate that at least 42 ± 5 per cent of local fast-rotating early-type galaxies have their gas supplied from external sources. When one also considers evidence of accretion present in the galaxies' atomic gas distributions, ≳46 per cent of fast-rotating field ETGs are likely to have acquired a detectable amount of ISM from accretion and mergers. We discuss several scenarios which could explain the environmental dichotomy, including preprocessing in galaxy groups/cluster outskirts and the morphological transformation of spiral galaxies, but we find it difficult to simultaneously explain the kinematic misalignment difference and the constant detection rate. Furthermore, our results suggest that galaxy mass may be an important independent factor associated with the origin of the gas, with the most massive fast-rotating galaxies in our sample (MK≲-24 mag; stellar mass of ≈8 × 1010 M⊙) always having kinematically aligned gas. This mass dependence appears to be independent of environment, suggesting it is caused by a separate physical mechanism.},

We find that the line ratios 12CO(1-0)/13CO(1-0) and 12CO(1-0)/HCN(1-0) are clearly correlated with several galaxy properties: total stellar mass, luminosity-weighted mean stellar age, molecular-to-atomic gas ratio, dust temperature and dust morphology. We suggest that these correlations are primarily governed by the optical depth in the 12CO lines; interacting, accreting and/or starbursting early-type galaxies have more optically thin molecular gas while those with settled dust and gas discs host optically thick molecular gas. The ranges of the integrated line intensity ratios generally overlap with those of spirals, although we note some outliers in the 12CO(1-0)/13CO(1-0), 12CO(2-1)/13CO(2-1) and HCN/HCO+(1-0) ratios. In particular, three galaxies are found to have very low 12CO(1-0)/13CO(1-0) and 12CO(2-1)/13CO(2-1) ratios. Such low ratios may signal particularly stable molecular gas which creates stars less efficiently than 'normal' (i.e. below Schmidt-Kennicutt prediction), consistent with the low dust temperatures seen in these galaxies.},

abstract = {We present the ATLAS3D H I survey of a volume-limited, complete sample of 166 nearby early-type galaxies (ETGs) brighter than MK=-21.5. The survey is mostly based on data taken with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope, which enables us to detect H I down to 5 × 106-5 × 107 M⊙ within the survey volume.  We detect ˜40 per cent of all ETGs outside the Virgo galaxy cluster and ˜10 per cent of all ETGs inside it. This demonstrates that it is common for non-cluster ETGs to host H I. The morphology of the detected gas varies in a continuous way from regular, settled H I discs and rings to unsettled gas distributions (including tidal or accretion tails) and systems of clouds scattered around the galaxy. The majority of the detections consist of H I discs or rings (1/4 of all ETGs outside Virgo) so that if H I is detected in an ETG it is most likely distributed on a settled configuration. These systems come in two main types: small discs [? M⊙], which are confined within the stellar body and share the same kinematics of the stars; and large discs/rings [M(H I) up to 5 × 109 M⊙], which extend to tens of kpc from the host galaxy and are in half of the cases kinematically decoupled from the stars.  Neutral hydrogen seems to provide material for star formation in ETGs. Galaxies containing H I within ˜1Re exhibit signatures of on-going star formation in ˜70 per cent of the cases, approximately five times more frequently than galaxies without central H I. The interstellar medium (ISM) in the centre of these galaxies is dominated by molecular gas, and in ETGs with a small gas disc the conversion of H I into H2 is as efficient as in spirals.  The ETG H I mass function is characterized by M*˜ 2 × 109 M⊙ and by a slope $\alpha$˜-0.7. Compared to spirals, ETGs host much less H I as a family. However, a significant fraction of all ETGs are as H I-rich as spiral galaxies. The main difference between ETGs and spirals is that the former lack the high-column-density H I typical of the bright stellar disc of the latter.  The ETG H I properties vary with environment density in a more continuous way than suggested by the known Virgo versus non-Virgo dichotomy. We find an envelope of decreasing M(H I) and M(H I)/LK with increasing environment density. The gas-richest galaxies live in the poorest environments (as found also with CO observations), where the detection rate of star formation signatures is higher. Galaxies in the centre of Virgo have the lowest H I content, while galaxies at the outskirts of Virgo represent a transition region and can contain significant amounts of H I, indicating that at least a fraction of them has joined the cluster only recently after pre-processing in groups. Finally, we find an H I morphology-density relation such that at low environment density (measured on a local scale) the detected H I is mostly distributed on large, regular discs and rings, while more disturbed H I morphologies dominate environment densities typical of rich groups. This confirms the importance of processes occurring on a galaxy-group scale for the evolution of ETGs.},

abstract = {We investigate the accuracy in the recovery of the stellar dynamics of barred galaxies when using axisymmetric dynamical models. We do this by trying to recover the mass-to-light ratio (M/L) and the anisotropy of realistic galaxy simulations using the Jeans Anisotropic Multi-Gaussian Expansion (JAM) modelling method. However, given that the biases we find are mostly due to an application of an axisymmetric modelling algorithm to a non-axisymmetric system and in particular to inaccuracies in the deprojected mass model, our results are relevant for general axisymmetric modelling methods. We run N-body collisionless simulations to build a library with various luminosity distribution, constructed to mimic real individual galaxies, with realistic anisotropy. The final result of our evolved library of simulations contains both barred and unbarred galaxies. The JAM method assumes an axisymmetric mass distribution, and we adopt a spatially constant M/L and anisotropy ? distributions. The models are fitted to two-dimensional maps of the second velocity moments ? of the simulations for various viewing angles [position angle (PA) of the bar and inclination of the galaxy]. We find that the inclination is generally well recovered by the JAM models, for both barred and unbarred simulations. For unbarred simulations the M/L is also accurately recovered, with negligible median bias and with a maximum one of just $\Delta$(M/L) {\textless} 1.5 per cent when the galaxy is not too close to face on. At very low inclinations (?) the M/L can be significantly overestimated (9 per cent in our tests, but errors can be larger for very face-on views). This is in agreement with previous studies. For barred simulations the M/L is on average (when PA = 45°) essentially unbiased, but we measure an over/underestimation of up to $\Delta$(M/L) = 15 per cent in our tests. The sign of the M/L bias depends on the PA of the bar as expected: overestimation occurs when the bar is closer to end-on, due to the increased stellar motion along the line-of-sight, and underestimation otherwise. For unbarred simulations, the JAM models are able to recover the mean value of the anisotropy with bias ?, within the region constrained by the kinematics. However when a bar is present, or for nearly face-on models, the recovered anisotropy varies wildly, with biases up to $\Delta$$\beta$z≈ 0.3.},

abstract = {We use interferometric 12CO(1-0) observations to compare and contrast the extent, surface brightness profiles and kinematics of the molecular gas in CO-rich ATLAS3D early-type galaxies (ETGs) and spiral galaxies. We find that the molecular gas extent is smaller in absolute terms in ETGs than in late-type galaxies, but that the size distributions are similar once scaled by the galaxies optical/stellar characteristic scalelengths. Amongst ETGs, we find that the extent of the gas is independent of its kinematic misalignment (with respect to the stars), but does depend on the environment, with Virgo cluster ETGs having less extended molecular gas reservoirs, further emphasizing that cluster ETGs follow different evolutionary pathways from those in the field. Approximately half of ETGs have molecular gas surface brightness profiles that follow the stellar light profile. These systems often have relaxed gas out to large radii, suggesting they are unlikely to have had recent merger/accretion events. A third of the sample galaxies show molecular gas surface brightness profiles that fall off slower than the light, and sometimes show a truncation. These galaxies often have a low mass, and either have disturbed molecular gas or are in the Virgo cluster, suggesting that recent mergers, ram pressure stripping and/or the presence of hot gas can compress/truncate the gas. The remaining galaxies have rings, or composite profiles, that we argue can be caused by the effects of bars. We investigated the kinematics of the molecular gas using position-velocity diagrams, and compared the observed kinematics with dynamical model predictions, and the observed stellar and ionized gas velocities. We confirm that the molecular gas reaches beyond the turnover of the circular velocity curve in ≈70 per cent of our CO-rich ATLAS3D ETGs, validating previous work on the CO Tully-Fisher relation. In general we find that in most galaxies the molecular gas is dynamically cold, and the observed CO rotation matches well model predictions of the circular velocity. In the galaxies with the largest molecular masses, dust obscuration and/or population gradients can cause model predictions of the circular velocity to disagree with observations of the molecular gas rotation; however, these effects are confined to the most star forming systems. Bars and non-equilibrium conditions can also make the gas deviate from circular orbits. In both these cases, one expects the model circular velocity to be higher than the observed CO velocity, in agreement with our observations. Molecular gas is a better direct tracer of the circular velocity than the ionized gas, justifying its use as a kinematic tracer for Tully-Fisher and similar analyses.},

abstract = {We study the volume-limited and nearly mass-selected (stellar mass Mstars ≳ 6 × 109 M⊙) ATLAS3D sample of 260 early-type galaxies (ETGs, ellipticals Es and lenticulars S0s). We construct detailed axisymmetric dynamical models (Jeans Anisotropic MGE), which allow for orbital anisotropy, include a dark matter halo and reproduce in detail both the galaxy images and the high-quality integral-field stellar kinematics out to about 1Re, the projected half-light radius. We derive accurate total mass-to-light ratios (M/L)e and dark matter fractions fDM, within a sphere of radius r={\{}R{\_}e{\}} centred on the galaxies. We also measure the stellar (M/L)stars and derive a median dark matter fraction fDM = 13 per cent in our sample. We infer masses MJAM ≡ L × (M/L)e ≈ 2 × M1/2, where M1/2 is the total mass within a sphere enclosing half of the galaxy light. We find that the thin two-dimensional subset spanned by galaxies in the (M{\_}JAM,$\sigma$ {\_}e,R{\_}e{\^{}}maj) coordinates system, which we call the Mass Plane (MP) has an observed rms scatter of 19 per cent, which implies an intrinsic one of 11 per cent. Here, R{\_}e{\^{}}maj is the major axis of an isophote enclosing half of the observed galaxy light, while $\sigma$e is measured within that isophote. The MP satisfies the scalar virial relation M{\_}JAM∝ $\sigma$ {\_}e{\^{}}2 R{\_}e{\^{}}maj within our tight errors. This show that the larger scatter in the Fundamental Plane (FP) (L, $\sigma$e, Re) is due to stellar population effects [including trends in the stellar initial mass function (IMF)]. It confirms that the FP deviation from the virial exponents is due to a genuine (M/L)e variation. However, the details of how both Re and $\sigma$e are determined are critical in defining the precise deviation from the virial exponents. The main uncertainty in masses or M/L estimates using the scalar virial relation is in the measurement of Re. This problem is already relevant for nearby galaxies and may cause significant biases in virial mass and size determinations at high redshift. Dynamical models can eliminate these problems. We revisit the (M/L)e-$\sigma$e relation, which describes most of the deviations between the MP and the FP. The best-fitting relation is (M/L){\_}e∝ $\sigma$ {\_}e{\^{}}{\{}0.72{\}} (r band). It provides an upper limit to any systematic increase of the IMF mass normalization with $\sigma$e. The correlation is more shallow and has smaller scatter for slow rotating systems or for galaxies in Virgo. For the latter, when using the best distance estimates, we observe a scatter in (M/L)e of 11 per cent, and infer an intrinsic one of 8 per cent. We perform an accurate empirical study of the link between $\sigma$e and the galaxies circular velocity Vcirc within 1Re (where stars dominate) and find the relation max (Vcirc) ≈ 1.76 × $\sigma$e, which has an observed scatter of 7 per cent. The accurate parameters described in this paper are used in the companion Paper XX (Cappellari et al.) of this series to explore the variation of global galaxy properties, including the IMF, on the projections of the MP.},

abstract = {We present a detailed study of the physical properties of the molecular gas in a sample of 18 molecular gas-rich early-type galaxies (ETGs) from the ATLAS3D sample. Our goal is to better understand the star formation processes occurring in those galaxies, starting here with the dense star-forming gas. We use existing integrated 12CO (1-0, 2-1), 13CO (1-0, 2-1), HCN (1-0) and HCO+ (1-0) observations and new 12 CO (3-2) single-dish data. From these, we derive for the first time the average kinetic temperature, H2 volume density and column density of the emitting gas in a significant sample of ETGs, using a non-local thermodynamical equilibrium theoretical model. Since the CO lines trace different physical conditions than of those the HCN and HCO+ lines, the two sets of lines are treated separately. For most of the molecular gas-rich ETGs studied here, the CO transitions can be reproduced with kinetic temperatures of 10-20 K, H2 volume densities of 103-4 cm-3 and CO column densities of 10{\^{}}{\{}18-20{\}} cm-2. The physical conditions corresponding to the HCN and HCO+ gas component have large uncertainties and must be considered as indicative only. We also compare for the first time the predicted CO spectral line energy distributions and gas properties of our molecular gas-rich ETGs with those of a sample of nearby well-studied disc galaxies. The gas excitation conditions in 13 of our 18 ETGs appear analogous to those in the centre of the Milky Way, hence the star formation activity driving these conditions is likely of a similar strength and nature. Such results have never been obtained before for ETGs and open a new window to explore further star-formation processes in the Universe. The conclusions drawn should nevertheless be considered carefully, as they are based on a limited number of observations and on a simple model. In the near future, with higher CO transition observations, it should be possible to better identify the various gas components present in ETGs, as well as more precisely determine their associated physical conditions. To achieve these goals, we show here from our theoretical study, that mid-J CO lines [such as the 12CO (6-5) line] are particularly useful.},

abstract = {We analyse the morphological structures in galaxies of the ATLAS3D sample by fitting a single S{\'{e}}rsic profile and decomposing all non-barred objects (180 of 260 objects) in two components parametrized by an exponential and a general S{\'{e}}rsic function. The aim of this analysis is to look for signatures of discs in light distributions of nearby early-type galaxies and compare them to kinematic properties. Using S{\'{e}}rsic index from single-component fits for a distinction between slow and fast rotators, or even late- and early-type galaxies, is not recommended. Assuming that objects with n {\textgreater} 3 are slow rotators (or ellipticals), there is only a 22 per cent probability to correctly classify objects as slow rotators (or 37 per cent of previously classified as ellipticals). We show that exponential sub-components, as well as light profiles fitted with only a single component of a low S{\'{e}}rsic index, can be linked with the kinematic evidence for discs in early-type galaxies. The median disc-to-total light ratio for fast and slow rotators is 0.41 and 0.0, respectively. Similarly, the median S{\'{e}}rsic indices of the bulge (general S{\'{e}}rsic component) are 1.7 and 4.8 for fast and slow rotators, respectively. Overall, discs or disc-like structures are present in 83 per cent of early-type galaxies which do not have bars, and they show a full range of disc-to-total light ratios. Discs in early-type galaxies contribute with about 40 per cent to the total mass of the analysed (non-barred) objects. The decomposition into discs and bulges can be used as a rough approximation for the separation between fast and slow rotators, but it is not a substitute, as there is only a 59 per cent probability to correctly recognize slow rotators. We find trends between the angular momentum and the disc-to-total light ratios and the S{\'{e}}rsic index of the bulge, in the sense that high angular momentum galaxies have large disc-to-total light ratios and small bulge indices, but there is none between the angular momentum and the global S{\'{e}}rsic index. We investigate the inclination effects on the decomposition results and confirm that strong exponential profiles can be distinguished even at low inclinations, but medium-size discs are difficult to quantify using photometry alone at inclinations lower than ˜50°. Kinematics (i.e. projected angular momentum) remains the best approach to mitigate the influence of the inclination effects. We also find weak trends with mass and environmental density, where disc-dominated galaxies are typically less massive and found at all densities, including the densest region sampled by the ATLAS3D sample.},

Our full sample of 40 galaxies (30 newly mapped and 10 taken from the literature) is complete to a 12CO(1-0) integrated flux of 18.5 Jy km s-1, and it represents the largest, best studied sample of its type to date. A comparison of the CO distribution of each galaxy to the g - r colour image (representing dust) shows that the molecular gas and dust distributions are in good agreement and trace the same underlying interstellar medium. The galaxies exhibit a variety of CO morphologies, including discs (50 per cent), rings (15 per cent), bars+rings (10 per cent), spiral arms (5 per cent) and mildly (12.5 per cent) and strongly (7.5 per cent) disrupted morphologies. There appear to be weak trends between galaxy mass and CO morphology, whereby the most massive galaxies in the sample tend to have molecular gas in a disc morphology. We derive a lower limit to the total accreted molecular gas mass across the sample of 2.48 × 1010 M⊙, or approximately 8.3 × 108 M⊙ per minor merger within the sample, consistent with minor merger stellar mass ratios.},

abstract = {For early-type galaxies, the ability to sustain a corona of hot, X-ray-emitting gas could have played a key role in quenching their star formation history. A halo of hot gas may act as an effective shield against the acquisition of cold gas and can quickly absorb stellar mass loss material. Yet, since the discovery by the Einstein Observatory of such X-ray haloes around early-type galaxies, the precise amount of hot gas around these galaxies still remains a matter of debate. By combining homogeneously derived photometric and spectroscopic measurements for the early-type galaxies observed as part of the ATLAS3D integral field survey with measurements of their X-ray luminosity based on X-ray data of both low and high spatial resolution (for 47 and 19 objects, respectively) we conclude that the hot gas content of early-type galaxies can depend on their dynamical structure. Specifically, whereas slow rotators generally have X-ray haloes with luminosity LX, gas and temperature T values that are well in line with what is expected if the hot gas emission is sustained by the thermalization of the kinetic energy carried by the stellar mass loss material, fast rotators tend to display LX, gas values that fall consistently below the prediction of this model, with similar T values that do not scale with the stellar kinetic energy (traced by the stellar velocity dispersion) as observed in the case of slow rotators. Such a discrepancy between the hot gas content of slow and fast rotators would appear to reduce, or even disappear, for large values of the dynamical mass (above ˜3 × 1011 M⊙), with younger fast rotators displaying also somewhat larger LX, gas values possibly owing to the additional energy input from recent supernovae explosions. Considering that fast rotators are likely to be intrinsically flatter than slow rotators, and that the few LX, gas-deficient slow rotators also happen to be relatively flat, the observed LX, gas deficiency in these objects would support the hypothesis whereby flatter galaxies have a harder time in retaining their hot gas, although we suggest that the degree of rotational support could further hamper the efficiency with which the kinetic energy of the stellar mass loss material is thermalized in the hot gas. We discuss the implications that a different hot gas content could have on the fate of both acquired and internally produced gaseous material, considering in particular how the LX, gas deficiency of fast rotators would make them more capable to recycle the stellar mass loss material into new stars than slow rotators. This would be consistent with the finding that molecular gas and young stellar populations are detected only in fast rotators across the entire ATLAS3D sample, and that fast rotators tend to have a larger specific dust mass content than slow rotators.},

Here, we use those parameters to study the two orthogonal projections ({\{}M{\_}JAM{\}}, {\{}$\sigma$ {\_}e{\}}) and ({\{}M{\_}JAM{\}}, {\{}R{\_}e{\^{}}maj{\}}) of the thin Mass Plane (MP) ({\{}M{\_}JAM{\}}, {\{}$\sigma$ {\_}e{\}}, {\{}R{\_}e{\^{}}maj{\}}) which describes the distribution of the galaxy population, where {\{}M{\_}JAM{\}}≡ L× (M/L){\_}JAM≈ M{\_}star. The distribution of galaxy properties on both projections of the MP is characterized by: (i) the same zone of exclusion (ZOE), which can be transformed from one projection to the other using the scalar virial equation. The ZOE is roughly described by two power laws, joined by a break at a characteristic mass {\{}M{\_}JAM{\}}≈ 3× 10{\^{}}{\{}10{\}} {\{} M{\_}{\{}⊙{\}}{\}}, which corresponds to the minimum Re and maximum stellar density. This results in a break in the mean {\{}M{\_}JAM{\}}-{\{}$\sigma$ {\_}e{\}} relation with trends {\{}M{\_}JAM{\}}∝ $\sigma$ {\_}e{\^{}}{\{}2.3{\}} and {\{}M{\_}JAM{\}}∝ $\sigma$ {\_}e{\^{}}{\{}4.7{\}} at small and large $\sigma$e, respectively; (ii) a characteristic mass {\{}M{\_}JAM{\}}≈ 2× 10{\^{}}{\{}11{\}} {\{} M{\_}{\{}⊙{\}}{\}} which separates a population dominated by flat fast rotator with discs and spiral galaxies at lower masses, from one dominated by quite round slow rotators at larger masses; (iii) below that mass the distribution of ETGs' properties on the two projections of the MP tends to be constant along lines of roughly constant $\sigma$e, or equivalently along lines with {\{}R{\_}e{\^{}}maj{\}}∝ {\{}M{\_}JAM{\}}, respectively (or even better parallel to the ZOE: {\{}R{\_}e{\^{}}maj{\}}∝ M{\_}JAM{\^{}}{\{}0.75{\}}); (iv) it forms a continuous and parallel sequence with the distribution of spiral galaxies; (v) at even lower masses, the distribution of fast-rotator ETGs and late spirals naturally extends to that of dwarf ETGs (Sph) and dwarf irregulars (Im), respectively.  We use dynamical models to analyse our kinematic maps. We show that $\sigma$e traces the bulge fraction, which appears to be the main driver for the observed trends in the dynamical (M/L)JAM and in indicators of the (M/L)pop of the stellar population like H$\beta$ and colour, as well as in the molecular gas fraction. A similar variation along contours of $\sigma$e is also observed for the mass normalization of the stellar initial mass function (IMF), which was recently shown to vary systematically within the ETGs' population. Our preferred relation has the form log {\_}{\{}10{\}} [(M/L){\_}stars/(M/L){\_}Salp]=a+b× log {\_}{\{}10{\}}({\{}$\sigma$ {\_}e{\}}/130 {\{}km s{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\}}) with a = -0.12 ± 0.01 and b = 0.35 ± 0.06. Unless there are major flaws in all stellar population models, this trend implies a transition of the mean IMF from Kroupa to Salpeter in the interval log {\_}{\{}10{\}}({\{}$\sigma$ {\_}e{\}}/{\{}km s{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}})≈ 1.9-2.5 (or {\{}$\sigma$ {\_}e{\}}≈ 90-290 km s-1), with a smooth variation in between, consistently with what was shown in Cappellari et al. The observed distribution of galaxy properties on the MP provides a clean and novel view for a number of previously reported trends, which constitute special two-dimensional projections of the more general four-dimensional parameters trends on the MP. We interpret it as due to a combination of two main effects: (i) an increase of the bulge fraction, which increases $\sigma$e, decreases Re, and greatly enhance the likelihood for a galaxy to have its star formation quenched, and (ii) dry merging, increasing galaxy mass and Re by moving galaxies along lines of roughly constant $\sigma$e (or steeper), while leaving the population nearly unchanged.},

abstract = {We explore the connection between the local escape velocity, Vesc, and the stellar population properties in the ATLAS3D survey, a complete, volume-limited sample of nearby early-type galaxies. We make use of ugriz photometry to construct Multi-Gaussian Expansion models of the surface brightnesses of our galaxies. We are able to fit the full range of surface brightness profiles found in our sample, and in addition we reproduce the results of state-of-the-art photometry in the literature with residuals of 0.04 mag. We utilize these photometric models and SAURON integral-field spectroscopy, combined with Jeans dynamical modelling, to determine the local Vesc derived from the surface brightness. We find that the local Vesc is tightly correlated with the Mg b and Fe5015 line strengths and optical colours, and anti-correlated with the H$\beta$ line strength. In the case of the Mg b and colour-Vesc relations we find that the relation within individual galaxies follows the global relation between different galaxies. We intentionally ignored any uncertain contribution due to dark matter since we are seeking an empirical description of stellar population gradients in early-type galaxies that is ideal for quantitative comparison with model predictions. We also make use of single stellar population (SSP) modelling to transform our line strength index measurements into the SSP-equivalent parameters age (t), metallicity ([Z/H]) and $\alpha$-enhancement [$\alpha$/Fe]. The residuals from the relation are correlated with age, [$\alpha$/Fe], molecular gas mass and local environmental density. We identify a population of galaxies that occur only at low Vesc that exhibit negative gradients in the Mg b- and Colour-Vesc relations. These galaxies typically have young central stellar populations and contain significant amounts of molecular gas and dust. Combining these results with N-body simulations of binary mergers we use the Mg b-Vesc relation to constrain the possible number of dry mergers experienced by the local early-type galaxy population - a typical massive early-type galaxy can have experienced only ˜1.5 major mergers before becoming a significant outlier in the Mg b-Vesc relation.},

abstract = {We study the global efficiency of star formation in high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations of gas discs embedded in isolated early-type and spiral galaxies. Despite using a universal local law to form stars in the simulations, we find that the early-type galaxies are offset from the spirals on the large-scale Kennicutt relation, and form stars two to five times less efficiently. This offset is in agreement with previous results on morphological quenching: gas discs are more stable against star formation when embedded in early-type galaxies due to the lower disc self-gravity and increased shear. As a result, these gas discs do not fragment into dense clumps and do not reach as high densities as in the spiral galaxies. Even if some molecular gas is present, the fraction of very dense gas (typically above 104 cm-3) is significantly reduced, which explains the overall lower star formation efficiency. We also analyse a sample of local early-type and spiral galaxies, measuring their CO and H I surface densities and their star formation rates as determined by their non-stellar 8 $\mu$m emission. As predicted by the simulations, we find that the early-type galaxies are offset from the Kennicutt relation compared to the spirals, with a twice lower efficiency. Finally, we validate our approach by performing a direct comparison between models and observations. We run a simulation designed to mimic the stellar and gaseous properties of NGC 524, a local lenticular galaxy, and find a gas disc structure and global star formation rate in good agreement with the observations. Morphological quenching thus seems to be a robust mechanism, and is also consistent with other observations of a reduced star formation efficiency in early-type galaxies in the COLD GASS survey. This lower efficiency of star formation is not enough to explain the formation of the whole red sequence, but can contribute to the reddening of some galaxies.},

abstract = {We investigate nuclear light profiles in 135 ATLAS3D galaxies for which the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging is available and compare them to the large-scale kinematics obtained with the SAURON integral-field spectrograph. Specific angular momentum, $\lambda$R, correlates with the shape of nuclear light profiles, where, as suggested by previous studies, cores are typically found in slow rotators and core-less galaxies are fast rotators. As also shown before, cores are found only in massive galaxies and only in systems with the stellar mass (measured via dynamical models) M ≳ 8 × 1010 M⊙. Based on our sample, we, however, see no evidence for a bimodal distribution of nuclear slopes. The best predictor for finding a core is based on the stellar velocity dispersion within an effective radius, $\sigma$e, and specific angular momentum, where cores are found for $\lambda$R ≲ 0.25 and $\sigma$e ≳ 160 km s-1. We estimate that only about 10 per cent of nearby early-type galaxies contain cores. Furthermore, we show that there is a genuine population of fast rotators with cores. We also show that core fast rotators are morphologically, kinematically and dynamically different from core slow rotators. The cores of fast rotators, however, could harbour black holes of similar masses to those in core slow rotators, but typically more massive than those found in core-less fast rotators. Cores of both fast and slow rotators are made of old stars and found in galaxies typically lacking molecular or atomic gas (with a few exceptions). Core-less galaxies, and especially core-less fast rotators, are underluminous in the diffuse X-ray emission, but the presence of a core does not imply high X-ray luminosities. Additionally, we postulate (as many of these galaxies lack HST imaging) a possible population of core-less galaxies among slow rotators, which cannot be explained as face-on discs, but comprise a genuine sub-population of slow rotators. These galaxies are typically less massive and flatter than core slow rotators, and show evidence for dynamical cold structures and exponential photometric components. Based on our findings, major non-dissipative (gas-poor) mergers together with black hole binary evolution may not be the only path for formation of cores in early-type galaxies. We discuss possible processes for formation of cores and their subsequent preservation.},

abstract = {We use the ATLAS3D sample to perform a study of the intrinsic shapes of early-type galaxies, taking advantage of the available combined photometric and kinematic data. Based on our ellipticity measurements from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7, and additional imaging from the Isaac Newton Telescope, we first invert the shape distribution of fast and slow rotators under the assumption of axisymmetry. The so-obtained intrinsic shape distribution for the fast rotators can be described with a Gaussian with a mean flattening of q = 0.25 and standard deviation $\sigma$q = 0.14, and an additional tail towards rounder shapes. The slow rotators are much rounder, and are well described with a Gaussian with mean q = 0.63 and $\sigma$q = 0.09. We then checked that our results were consistent when applying a different and independent method to obtain intrinsic shape distributions, by fitting the observed ellipticity distributions directly using Gaussian parametrizations for the intrinsic axis ratios. Although both fast and slow rotators are identified as early-type galaxies in morphological studies, and in many previous shape studies are therefore grouped together, their shape distributions are significantly different, hinting at different formation scenarios. The intrinsic shape distribution of the fast rotators shows similarities with the spiral galaxy population. Including the observed kinematic misalignment in our intrinsic shape study shows that the fast rotators are predominantly axisymmetric, with only very little room for triaxiality. For the slow rotators though there are very strong indications that they are (mildly) triaxial.},

abstract = {We present a detailed two-dimensional stellar dynamical analysis of a sample of 44 cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of individual central galaxies with stellar masses of 2 × 1010 M⊙ ≲ M* ≲ 6 × 1011 M⊙. Kinematic maps of the stellar line-of-sight velocity, velocity dispersion and higher order Gauss-Hermite moments h3 and h4 are constructed for each central galaxy and for the most massive satellites. The amount of rotation is quantified using the $\lambda$R-parameter. The velocity, velocity dispersion, h3 and h4 fields of the simulated galaxies show a diversity similar to observed kinematic maps of early-type galaxies in the ATLAS3D survey. This includes fast (regular), slow and misaligned rotation, hot spheroids with embedded cold disc components as well as galaxies with counter-rotating cores or central depressions in the velocity dispersion. We link the present-day kinematic properties to the individual cosmological formation histories of the galaxies. In general, major galaxy mergers have a significant influence on the rotation properties resulting in both a spin-down as well as a spin-up of the merger remnant. Lower mass galaxies with significant (≳18 per cent) in situ formation of stars since z ≈ 2, or with additional gas-rich major mergers - resulting in a spin-up - in their formation history, form elongated (ɛ ˜ 0.45) fast rotators ($\lambda$R ˜ 0.46) with a clear anticorrelation of h3 and v/$\sigma$. An additional formation path for fast rotators includes gas-poor major mergers leading to a spin-up of the remnants ($\lambda$R ˜ 0.43). This formation path does not result in anticorrelated h3 and v/$\sigma$. The formation histories of slow rotators can include late major mergers. If the merger is gas rich, the remnant typically is a less flattened slow rotator with a central dip in the velocity dispersion. If the merger is gas poor, the remnant is very elongated (ɛ ˜ 0.43) and slowly rotating ($\lambda$R ˜ 0.11). The galaxies most consistent with the rare class of non-rotating round early-type galaxies grow by gas-poor minor mergers alone. In general, more massive galaxies have less in situ star formation since z ˜ 2, rotate slower and have older stellar populations. We discuss general implications for the formation of fast and slowly rotating galaxies as well as the weaknesses and strengths of the underlying models.},

abstract = {One quarter of all nearby early-type galaxies (ETGs) outside Virgo host a disc/ring of H I with size from a few to tens of kpc and mass up to ˜109 M⊙. Here we investigate whether this H I is related to the presence of a stellar disc within the host making use of the classification of ETGs in fast and slow rotators (FR/SR). We find a large diversity of H I masses and morphologies within both families. Surprisingly, SRs are detected as often, host as much H I and have a similar rate of H I discs/rings as FRs. Accretion of H I is therefore not always linked to the growth of an inner stellar disc. The weak relation between H I and stellar disc is confirmed by their frequent kinematical misalignment in FRs, including cases of polar and counterrotating gas. In SRs the H I is usually polar. This complex picture highlights a diversity of ETG formation histories which may be lost in the relative simplicity of their inner structure and emerges when studying their outer regions. We find that $\Lambda$ CDM hydrodynamical simulations have difficulties reproducing the H I properties of ETGs. The gas discs formed in simulations are either too massive or too small depending on the star formation feedback implementation. Kinematical misalignments match the observations only qualitatively. The main point of conflict is that nearly all simulated FRs and a large fraction of all simulated SRs host corotating H I. This establishes the H I properties of ETGs as a novel challenge to simulations.},

abstract = {We present a study of the cold gas contents of the ATLAS3D early-type galaxies, in the context of their optical colours, near-ultraviolet colours and H$\beta$ absorption line strengths. Early-type (elliptical and lenticular) galaxies are not as gas poor as previously thought, and at least 40 per cent of local early-type galaxies are now known to contain molecular and/or atomic gas. This cold gas offers the opportunity to study recent galaxy evolution through the processes of cold gas acquisition, consumption (star formation) and removal. Molecular and atomic gas detection rates range from 10 to 34 per cent in red sequence early-type galaxies, depending on how the red sequence is defined, and from 50 to 70 per cent in blue early-type galaxies. Notably, massive red sequence early-type galaxies (stellar masses {\textgreater}5 × 1010 M⊙, derived from dynamical models) are found to have H I masses up to M(H I)/M* ˜ 0.06 and H2 masses up to M(H2)/M* ˜ 0.01. Some 20 per cent of all massive early-type galaxies may have retained atomic and/or molecular gas through their transition to the red sequence. However, kinematic and metallicity signatures of external gas accretion (either from satellite galaxies or the intergalactic medium) are also common, particularly at stellar masses ≤5 × 1010 M⊙, where such signatures are found in ˜50 per cent of H2-rich early-type galaxies. Our data are thus consistent with a scenario in which fast rotator early-type galaxies are quenched former spiral galaxies which have undergone some bulge growth processes, and in addition, some of them also experience cold gas accretion which can initiate a period of modest star formation activity. We discuss implications for the interpretation of colour-magnitude diagrams.},

abstract = {We present measurements of the star formation rate (SFR) in the early-type galaxies (ETGs) of the ATLAS3D sample, based on Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) 22 $\mu$m and Galaxy Evolution Explorer far-ultraviolet emission. We combine these with gas masses estimated from 12CO and H I data in order to investigate the star formation efficiency (SFE) in a larger sample of ETGs than previously available. We first recalibrate (based on WISE data) the relation between old stellar populations (traced at Ks band) and 22 $\mu$m luminosity, allowing us to remove the contribution of 22 $\mu$m emission from circumstellar dust. We then go on to investigate the position of ETGs on the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation. Molecular gas-rich ETGs have comparable star formation surface densities to normal spiral galaxy centres, but they lie systematically offset from the KS relation, having lower SFEs by a factor of ≈2.5 (in agreement with other authors). This effect is driven by galaxies where a substantial fraction of the molecular material is in the rising part of the rotation curve, and shear is high. We show here for the first time that although the number of stars formed per unit gas mass per unit time is lower in ETGs, it seems that the amount of stars formed per free-fall time is approximately constant. The scatter around this dynamical relation still correlates with galaxy properties such as the shape of the potential in the inner regions. This leads us to suggest that dynamical properties (such as shear or the global stability of the gas) may be important second parameters that regulate star formation and cause much of the scatter around star formation relations.},

abstract = {The unexpected rising flux of early-type galaxies at decreasing ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths is a long-standing mystery. One important observational constraint is the correlation between UV-optical colours and Mg2 line strengths found by Burstein et al. The simplest interpretation of this phenomenon is that the UV strength is related to the Mg line strength. Under this assumption, we expect galaxies with larger Mg gradients to have larger UV colour gradients. By combining UV imaging from GALEX, optical imaging from MDM and SAURON integral-field spectroscopy, we investigate the spatially resolved relationships between UV colours and stellar population properties of 34 early-type galaxies from the SAURON survey sample. We find that galaxies with old stellar populations show tight correlations between the far-UV (FUV) colours (FUV -V and FUV - NUV) and the Mg b index, H{\{}beta{\}} index and metallicity [Z/H]. The equivalent correlations for the Fe5015 index, -enhancement [/Fe] and age are present but weaker. We have also derived logarithmic internal radial colour, measured line strength and derived stellar population gradients for each galaxy and again found a strong dependence of the FUV -V and FUV - NUV colour gradients on both the Mg b line strength and the metallicity gradients for galaxies with old stellar populations. In particular, global gradients of Mg b and [Z/H] with respect to the UV colour [e.g. {\{}Delta{\}}(Mg b)/{\{}Delta{\}}(FUV - NUV) and {\{}Delta{\}}[Z/H]/{\{}Delta{\}}(FUV - NUV)] across galaxies are consistent with their local gradients within galaxies, suggesting that the global correlations also hold locally. From a simple model based on multiband colour fits of UV upturn and UV-weak galaxies, we have identified a plausible range of parameters that reproduces the observed radial colour profiles. In these models, the centres of elliptical galaxies, where the UV flux is strong, are enhanced in metals by roughly 60 per cent compared to UV-weak regions.},

abstract = {We present the results of an investigation of the local escape velocity (Vesc)- line strength index relationship for 48 early-type galaxies from the SAURON sample, the first such study based on a large sample of galaxies with both detailed integral field observations and extensive dynamical modelling. Values of Vesc are computed using multi-Gaussian expansion (MGE) photometric fitting and axisymmetric, anisotropic Jeans' dynamical modelling simultaneously on Hubble Space Telescope and ground-based images. We determine line strengths and escape velocities at multiple radii within each galaxy, allowing an investigation of the correlation within individual galaxies as well as amongst galaxies. We find a tight correlation between Vesc and the line-strength indices. For Mgb, we find that this correlation exists not only between different galaxies but also inside individual galaxies - it is both a local and global correlation. The Mgb-Vesc relation has the form: log(Mgb/4 A) = (0.32 {\{}+/-{\}} 0.03) log(Vesc/500 km s-1) - (0.031 {\{}+/-{\}} 0.007) with an rms scatter {\{}sigma{\}}= 0.033. The relation within individual galaxies has the same slope and offset as the global relation to a good level of agreement, though there is significant intrinsic scatter in the local gradients. We transform our line strength index measurements to the single stellar population (SSP) equivalent ages (t), metallicity ([Z/H]) and enhancement ([/Fe]) and carry out a principal component analysis of our SSP and Vesc data. We find that in this four-dimensional parameter space the galaxies in our sample are to a good approximation confined to a plane, given by log (V esc/500 km s -1) = 0.85 [Z/H]+ 0.43 log (t/Gyr) - 0.29. It is surprising that a combination of age and metallicity is conserved; this may indicate a  conspiracy' between age and metallicity or a weakness in the SSP models. How the connection between stellar populations and the gravitational potential, both locally and globally, is preserved as galaxies assemble hierarchically may provide an important constraint on modelling.},

We investigate how this colour, which is unaffected by dust extinction, can be used to constrain the stellar populations in these galaxies. We find a tight relation between the [3.6]-[4.5] colour and effective velocity dispersion, a good mass indicator in early-type galaxies: ([3.6]-[4.5])e = (-0.109 [IMG]/medium/mnras0419-2031-mu1.gif" ALT="Formula "{\textgreater} 0.007)[IMG]/medium/mnras0419-2031-mu2.gif" ALT="Formula "{\textgreater}+ (0.154 [IMG]/medium/mnras0419-2031-mu3.gif" ALT="Formula "{\textgreater} 0.016). Contrary to other colours in the optical and near-infrared, we find that the colours become bluer for larger galaxies. The relations are tighter when using the colour inside re (scatter 0.013 mag), rather than the much smaller re/8 aperture (scatter 0.023 mag), due to the presence of young populations in the central regions. We also obtain strong correlations between the [3.6]-[4.5] colour and three strong absorption lines (H[IMG]/medium/mnras0419-2031-mu4.gif" ALT="Formula "{\textgreater}, Mgb and Fe 5015). Comparing our data with the models of Marigo et al., which show that more metal rich galaxies are bluer, we can explain our results in a way consistent with results from the optical, by stating that larger galaxies are more metal rich. The blueing is caused by a strong CO absorption band, whose line strength increases strongly with decreasing temperature and which covers a considerable fraction of the 4.5-[IMG]/medium/mnras0419-2031-mu5.gif" ALT="Formula "{\textgreater}m filter. In galaxies that contain a compact radio source, the [3.6]-[4.5] colour is generally slightly redder (by 0.015 [IMG]/medium/mnras0419-2031-mu6.gif" ALT="Formula "{\textgreater} 0.007 mag using the re/8 aperture) than in the other galaxies, indicating small amounts of either hot dust, non-thermal emission, or young stars near the centre.

Removing the regions with evidence for young stellar populations (from the H[IMG]/medium/mnras0419-2031-mu7.gif" ALT="Formula "{\textgreater} absorption line) and interpreting the colour gradients as metallicity gradients, we find that our galaxies are more metal poor going outwards. The radial [3.6]-[4.5] gradients correlate very well with the metallicity gradients derived from optical line indices. We do not find any correlation between the gradients and galaxy mass; at every mass, galaxies display a real range in metallicity gradients. Consistent with our previous work on line indices, we find a tight relation between local [3.6]-[4.5] colour and local escape velocity. The small scatter from galaxy to galaxy, although not negligible, shows that the amount and distribution of the dark matter relative to the visible light cannot be too different from galaxy to galaxy. Due to the lower sensitivity of the [3.6]-[4.5] colour to young stellar populations, this relation is more useful to infer the galaxy potential than the Mgb-vesc relation.},

abstract = {Using far-ultraviolet (FUV) and near-ultraviolet (NUV) photometry from guest investigator programmes on the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) satellite, optical photometry from the MDM Observatory and optical integral-field spectroscopy from SAURON, we explore the UV-line-strength relations of the 48 nearby early-type galaxies in the SAURON sample. Identical apertures are used for all quantities, avoiding aperture mismatch. We show that galaxies with purely old stellar populations show well-defined correlations of the integrated FUV -V and FUV - NUV colours with the integrated Mg b and H{\{}beta{\}} absorption line-strength indices, strongest for FUV - NUV. Correlations with the NUV -V colour, Fe5015 index and stellar velocity dispersion {\{}sigma{\}} are much weaker. These correlations put stringent constraints on the origin of the UV-upturn phenomenon in early-type galaxies and highlight its dependence on age and metallicity. In particular, despite recent debate, we recover the negative correlation between FUV -V colour and Mg line strength originally publicized by Burstein et al., which we refer to as the  Burstein relation', suggesting a positive dependence of the UV upturn on metallicity. We argue that the scatter in the correlations is real and present mild evidence that a strong UV excess is preferentially present in slow-rotating galaxies. We also demonstrate that most outliers in the correlations are galaxies with current or recent star formation, some at very low levels. We believe that this sensitivity to weak star formation, afforded by the deep and varied data available for the SAURON sample, explains why our results are occasionally at odds with other recent but shallower surveys. This is supported by the analysis of a large, carefully crafted sample of more distant early-type galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), more easily comparable with current and future large surveys.},

Using high-quality spectra, spatially binned to a constant signal-to-noise ratio, we measure several key age, metallicity and abundance ratio sensitive indices from the Lick Observatory Image Dissector Scanner (Lick/IDS) system over a contiguous two-dimensional field including bulge and inner disc. We present maps of H{\{}beta{\}}, Fe 5015 and Mg b for each galaxy. We find that Sa galaxies on the average have slightly smaller Mg b and Fe 5015 line strengths than ellipticals and S0s, and higher H{\{}beta{\}} values, but with a much larger scatter. The absorption-line maps show that many galaxies contain some younger populations ([{\&}le;]1 Gyr), distributed in small or large inner discs, or in circumnuclear star-forming rings. In many cases these young stars are formed in circumnuclear ministarbursts, which are dominating the light in the centres of some of the early-type spirals. These ministarburst cause a considerable scatter in index-index diagrams such as Mg b-H{\{}beta{\}} and Mg b-Fe 5015, more than is measured for early-type galaxies. We find that the central regions of Sa galaxies display a wide range in ages, even within the galaxies. We find that the central regions of early-type spirals are often dusty, with a good correlation between the presence of young central stellar populations and a significant amount of dust extinction. 50 per cent of the sample show velocity dispersion drops in their centres. All of the galaxies of our sample lie on or below the Mg b-{\{}sigma{\}} relation for elliptical galaxies in the Coma cluster, and above the H{\{}beta{\}} absorption line-{\{}sigma{\}} relation for elliptical galaxies. If those relations are considered to be relations for the oldest local galaxies we see that our sample of spirals has a considerable scatter in age, with the largest scatter at the lowest {\{}sigma{\}}. This is in disagreement with highly inclined samples, in which generally only old stellar populations are found in the central regions. The discrepancy between our sample and highly inclined samples, and the presence of so many stellar velocity dispersion dips, i.e. so-called {\{}sigma{\}} drops, in these spiral galaxies with large bulges (type Sa) can be understood if the central regions of Sa galaxies contain at least two components: a thin, disc-like component, often containing recent star formation, and another, elliptical-like component, consisting of old stars and rotating more slowly, dominating the light above the plane. These components together form the photometrically defined bulge, in the same way as the thin and the thick disc co-exist in the solar neighbourhood. In this picture, consistent with the current literature, part of the bulge, the thicker component, formed a very long time ago. Later, stars continued to form in the central regions of the disc, rejuvenating in this way the bulge through dynamical processes. This picture is able to explain in a natural way the heterogeneous stellar populations and star formation characteristics that we are seeing in detailed observations of early-type spiral galaxies.},

abstract = {We analysed two-dimensional maps of 48 early-type galaxies obtained with the SAURON and OASIS integral-field spectrographs using kinemetry, a generalization of surface photometry to the higher order moments of the line-of-sight velocity distribution (LOSVD). The maps analysed include: reconstructed image, mean velocity, velocity dispersion, h3 and h4 Gauss-Hermite moments. Kinemetry is a good method to recognize structures otherwise missed by using surface photometry, such as embedded discs and kinematic subcomponents. In the SAURON sample, we find that 31 per cent of early-type galaxies are single component systems. 91 per cent of the multicomponents systems have two kinematic subcomponents, the rest having three. In addition, 29 per cent of galaxies have kinematically decoupled components, nuclear components with significant kinematic twists. We differentiate between slow and fast rotators using velocity maps only and find that fast-rotating galaxies contain discs with a large range in mass fractions to the main body. Specifically, we find that the velocity maps of fast rotators closely resemble those of inclined discs, except in the transition regions between kinematic subcomponents. This deviation is measured with the kinemetric k5/k1 ratio, which is large and noisy in slow rotators and about 2 per cent in fast rotators. In terms of E/S0 classification, this means that 74 per cent of Es and 92 per cent of S0s have components with disc-like kinematics. We suggest that differences in k5/k1 values for the fast and slow rotators arise from their different intrinsic structure which is reflected on the velocity maps. For the majority of fast rotators, the kinematic axial ratios are equal to or less than their photometric axial ratios, contrary to what is predicted with isotropic Jeans models viewed at different inclinations. The position angles of fast rotators are constant, while they vary abruptly in slow rotators. Velocity dispersion maps of face-on galaxies have shapes similar to the distribution of light. Velocity dispersion maps of the edge-on fast rotators and all slow rotators show differences which can only be partially explained with isotropic models and, in the case of fast rotators, often require additional cold components. We constructed local (bin-by-bin) h3-V/{\{}sigma{\}} and h4-V/{\{}sigma{\}} diagrams from SAURON observations. We confirm the classical anticorrelation of h3 and V/{\{}sigma{\}}, but we also find that h3 is almost zero in some objects or even weakly correlated with V/{\{}sigma{\}}. The distribution of h4 for fast and slow rotators is mildly positive on average. In general, fast rotators contain flattened components characterized by a disc-like rotation. The difference between slow and fast rotators is traceable throughout all moments of the LOSVD, with evidence for different intrinsic shapes and orbital contents and, hence, likely different evolutionary paths.},

abstract = {We present a stellar population analysis of the absorption line strength maps for 48 early-type galaxies from the SAURON sample. Using the line strength index maps of H{\{}beta{\}}, Fe5015 and Mg b, measured in the Lick/IDS system and spatially binned to a constant signal-to-noise ratio, together with predictions from up-to-date stellar population models, we estimate the simple stellar population-equivalent (SSP-equivalent) age, metallicity and abundance ratio [/Fe] over a two-dimensional field extending up to approximately one effective radius. A discussion of calibrations and differences between model predictions is given. Maps of SSP-equivalent age, metallicity and abundance ratio [/Fe] are presented for each galaxy. We find a large range of SSP-equivalent ages in our sample, of which [{\~{}}]40 per cent of the galaxies show signs of a contribution from a young stellar population. The most extreme cases of post-starburst galaxies, with SSP-equivalent ages of [{\&}le;]3 Gyr observed over the full field-of-view, and sometimes even showing signs of residual star formation, are restricted to low-mass systems ({\{}sigma{\}}e[{\&}le;] 100 km s-1 or [{\~{}}]2 x 1010 M{\{}odot{\}}). Spatially restricted cases of young stellar populations in circumnuclear regions can almost exclusively be linked to the presence of star formation in a thin, dusty disc/ring, also seen in the near-UV or mid-IR on top of an older underlying stellar population. The flattened components with disc-like kinematics previously identified in all fast rotators are shown to be connected to regions of distinct stellar populations. These range from the young, still star-forming circumnuclear discs and rings with increased metallicity preferentially found in intermediate-mass fast rotators, to apparently old structures with extended disc-like kinematics, which are observed to have an increased metallicity and mildly depressed [/Fe] ratio compared to the main body of the galaxy. The slow rotators, often harbouring kinematically decoupled components (KDC) in their central regions, generally show no stellar population signatures over and above the well-known metallicity gradients in early-type galaxies and are largely consistent with old ([{\&}ge;]10 Gyr) stellar populations. Using radially averaged stellar population gradients we find in agreement with Spolaor et al. a mass-metallicity gradient relation where low-mass fast rotators form a sequence of increasing metallicity gradient with increasing mass. For more massive systems (above [{\~{}}]3.5 x 1010 M{\{}odot{\}}) there is an overall downturn such that metallicity gradients become shallower with increased scatter at a given mass leading to the most massive systems being slow rotators with relatively shallow metallicity gradients. The observed shallower metallicity gradients and increased scatter could be a consequence of the competition between different star formation and assembly scenarios following a general trend of diminishing gas fractions and more equal-mass mergers with increasing mass, leading to the most massive systems being devoid of ordered motion and signs of recent star formation.},

abstract = {Two-dimensional stellar kinematics of 48 representative elliptical (E) and lenticular (S0) galaxies obtained with the SAURON integral-field spectrograph reveal that early-type galaxies appear in two broad flavours, depending on whether they exhibit clear large-scale rotation or not. We define a new parameter [IMG]/medium/mnras0379-0401-mu1.gif" ALT="Formula "{\textgreater}, which involves luminosity-weighted averages over the full two-dimensional kinematic field as a proxy to quantify the observed projected stellar angular momentum per unit mass. We use it as a basis for a new kinematic classification: early-type galaxies are separated into slow and fast rotators, depending on whether they have {\{}lambda{\}}R values within their effective radius Re below or above 0.1, respectively. Slow and fast rotators are shown to be physically distinct classes of galaxies, a result which cannot simply be the consequence of a biased viewing angle. Fast rotators tend to be relatively low-luminosity galaxies with MB{\{}gtrsim{\}}-20.5. Slow rotators tend to be brighter and more massive galaxies, but are still spread over a wide range of absolute magnitude. Three slow rotators of our sample, among the most massive ones, are consistent with zero rotation. Remarkably, all other slow rotators (besides the atypical case of NGC 4550) contain a large kpc-scale kinematically decoupled core (KDC). All fast rotators (except one galaxy with well-known irregular shells) show well-aligned photometric and kinemetric axes, and small velocity twists, in contrast with most slow rotators which exhibit significant misalignments and velocity twists. These results are supported by a supplement of 18 additional early-type galaxies observed with SAURON. In a companion paper (Paper X), we also show that fast and slow rotators are distinct classes in terms of their orbital distribution. We suggest that gas is a key ingredient in the formation and evolution of fast rotators, and that the slowest rotators are the extreme evolutionary end point reached deep in gravitational potential wells where dissipationless mergers had a major role in the evolution, and for which most of the baryonic angular momentum was expelled outwards. Detailed numerical simulations in a cosmological context are required to understand how to form large-scale KDCs within slow rotators, and more generally to explain the distribution of {\{}lambda{\}}R values within early-type galaxies and the distinction between fast and slow rotators.},

These seeing-limited observations explore the central 8 x 10 arcsec2 (typically 1 kpc diameter) regions of these galaxies using a spatial sampling four times higher than SAURON (0.27-arcsec versus 0.94-arcsec spatial elements), resulting in almost a factor of 2 improvement in the median point spread function. These data allow accurate study of the central regions to complement the large-scale view provided by SAURON. Here we present the stellar and gas kinematics, stellar absorption-line strengths and nebular emission-line strengths for this sample. We also characterize the stellar velocity maps using the  kinemetry' technique, and derive maps of the luminosity-weighted stellar age, metallicity and abundance ratio via stellar population models. We give a brief review of the structures found in our maps, linking also to larger-scale structures measured with SAURON. We present two previously unreported kinematically decoupled components (KDCs) in the centres of NGC 3032 and NGC 4382. We compare the intrinsic size and luminosity-weighted stellar age of all the visible KDCs in the full SAURON sample, and find two types of components: kiloparsec-scale KDCs, which are older than 8 Gyr, and are found in galaxies with little net rotation; and compact KDCs, which have intrinsic diameters of less than a few hundred parsec, show a range of stellar ages from 0.5 to 15 Gyr (with 5/6 younger than 5 Gyr), are found exclusively in fast-rotating galaxies, and are close to counter-rotating around the same axis as their host. Of the seven galaxies in the SAURON sample with integrated luminosity-weighted ages less than 5 Gyr, five show such compact KDCs, suggesting a link between counter-rotation and recent star formation. We show that this may be due to a combination of small sample size at young ages, and an observational bias, since young KDCs are easier to detect than their older and/or corotating counterparts.},

abstract = {We combine SAURON integral field data of a representative sample of local early-type, red sequence galaxies with Spitzer/Infrared Array Camera imaging in order to investigate the presence of trace star formation in these systems. With the Spitzer data, we identify galaxies hosting low-level star formation, as traced by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission, with measured star formation rates that compare well to those estimated from other tracers. This star formation proceeds according to established scaling relations with molecular gas content, in surface density regimes characteristic of disc galaxies and circumnuclear starbursts. We find that star formation in early-type galaxies happens exclusively in fast-rotating systems and occurs in two distinct modes. In the first, star formation is a diffuse process, corresponding to widespread young stellar populations and high molecular gas content. The equal presence of co- and counter-rotating components in these systems strongly implies an external origin for the star-forming gas, and we argue that these star formation events may be the final stages of (mostly minor) mergers that build up the bulges of red sequence lenticulars. In the second mode of star formation, the process is concentrated into well-defined disc or ring morphologies, outside of which the host galaxies exhibit uniformly evolved stellar populations. This implies that these star formation events represent rejuvenations within previously quiescent stellar systems. Evidence for earlier star formation events similar to these in all fast-rotating early-type galaxies suggests that this mode of star formation may be common to all such galaxies, with a duty cycle of roughly 1/10, and likely contributes to the embedded, corotating inner stellar discs ubiquitous in this population.},

abstract = {We analyse the orbital distribution of elliptical (E) and lenticular (S0) galaxies using SAURON integral-field stellar kinematics within about one effective (half-light) radius. We construct the anisotropy diagram, which relates the ratio of the ordered and random motion in a galaxy (V/{\{}sigma{\}}) to its observed ellipticity ({\{}varepsilon{\}}), for the 48 E/S0 galaxies from the SAURON survey. For a subsample of 24 galaxies consistent with axisymmetry, we use three-integral axisymmetric Schwarzschild dynamical models to recover the detailed orbital distribution, and we find good agreement with the anisotropy derived from the (V/{\{}sigma{\}}, {\{}varepsilon{\}}) diagram. In a companion paper (Paper IX), we show that the early-type galaxies can be subdivided into two classes of systems with or without a significant amount of specific stellar angular momentum. Here, we show that the two classes have different distributions on the (V/{\{}sigma{\}}, {\{}varepsilon{\}}) diagram. The slow rotators are more common among the most massive systems and are generally classified as E from photometry alone. Those in our sample tend to be fairly round ({\{}varepsilon{\}}[lsim] 0.3), but can have significant kinematical misalignments, indicating that as a class they are moderately triaxial, and span a range of anisotropies ({\{}delta{\}}[lsim] 0.3). The fast rotators are generally fainter and are classified as either E or S0. They can appear quite flattened ({\{}varepsilon{\}}[lsim] 0.7), do not show significant kinematical misalignments (unless barred or interacting), indicating they are nearly axisymmetric and span an even larger range of anisotropies ({\{}delta{\}}[lsim] 0.5). These results are confirmed when we extend our analysis to 18 additional E/S0 galaxies observed with SAURON. The dynamical models indicate that the anisotropy inferred from the (V/{\{}sigma{\}}, {\{}varepsilon{\}}) diagram is due to a flattening of the velocity ellipsoid in the meridional plane ({\{}sigma{\}}R {\textgreater} {\{}sigma{\}}z), which we quantify with the {\{}beta{\}} anisotropy parameter. We find a trend of increasing {\{}beta{\}} for intrinsically flatter galaxies. A number of the fast rotators show evidence for containing a flattened, kinematically distinct component, which in some cases counter-rotates relative to the main galaxy body. These components are generally more metal rich than the galaxy body. All these results support the idea that fast rotators are nearly oblate and contain disc-like components. The role of gas must have been important for their formation. The slow rotators are weakly triaxial. Current collisionless merger models seem unable to explain their detailed observed properties.},

The surface brightness profiles of nine galaxies ({\{}approx{\}}26 per cent) show regions with blue UV-optical colours suggesting RSF. Five of these ({\{}approx{\}}15 per cent) show blue integrated UV-optical colours that set them aside in the NUV integrated colour-magnitude relation. These are objects with either exceptionally intense and localized NUV fluxes or blue UV-optical colours throughout. They also have other properties confirming they have had RSF, in particular H{\{}beta{\}} absorption higher than expected for a quiescent population and a higher CO detection rate. This suggests that residual star formation is more common in early-type galaxies than we are used to believe. NUV blue galaxies are generally drawn from the lower stellar velocity dispersion ({\{}sigma{\}}e {\textless} 200 km s-1) and thus lower dynamical mass part of the sample. We have also constructed the first UV Fundamental Planes and show that NUV blue galaxies bias the slopes and increase the scatters. If they are eliminated, the fits get closer to expectations from the virial theorem. Although our analysis is based on a limited sample, it seems that a dominant fraction of the tilt and scatter of the UV Fundamental Planes is due to the presence of young stars in preferentially low-mass early-type galaxies. Interestingly, the UV-optical radial colour profiles reveal a variety of behaviours, with many galaxies showing signs of RSF, a central UV-upturn phenomenon, smooth but large-scale age and metallicity gradients and in many cases a combination of these. In addition, FUV-NUV and FUV-V colours even bluer than those normally associated with UV-upturn galaxies are observed at the centre of some quiescent galaxies. Four out of the five UV-upturn galaxies are slow rotators. These objects should thus pose interesting challenges to stellar evolutionary models of the UV upturn.},

abstract = {Early results are reported from the SAURON survey of the kinematics and stellar populations of a representative sample of nearby E, S0 and Sa galaxies. The survey is aimed at determining the intrinsic shape of the galaxies, their orbital structure, the mass-to-light ratio as a function of radius, the age and metallicity of the stellar populations, and the frequency of kinematically decoupled cores and nuclear black holes. The construction of the representative sample is described, and its properties are illustrated. A comparison with long-slit spectroscopic data establishes that the SAURON measurements are comparable to, or better than, the highest-quality determinations. Comparisons are presented for NGC 3384 and 4365, where stellar velocities and velocity dispersions are determined to a precision of 6 km s-1, and the h3 and h4 parameters of the line-of-sight velocity distribution to a precision of better than 0.02. Extraction of accurate gas emission-line intensities, velocities and linewidths from the data cubes is illustrated for NGC 5813. Comparisons with published line strengths for NGC 3384 and 5813 reveal uncertainties of [lsim]0.1 A on the measurements of the H{\{}beta{\}}, Mg b and Fe5270 indices. Integral-field mapping uniquely connects measurements of the kinematics and stellar populations to the galaxy morphology. The maps presented here illustrate the rich stellar kinematics, gaseous kinematics, and line-strength distributions of early-type galaxies. The results include the discovery of a thin, edge-on, disc in NGC 3623, confirm the axisymmetric shape of the central region of M32, illustrate the LINER nucleus and surrounding counter-rotating star-forming ring in NGC 7742, and suggest a uniform stellar population in the decoupled core galaxy NGC 5813.},

abstract = {We present absorption line strength maps of 48 representative elliptical and lenticular galaxies obtained as part of a survey of nearby galaxies using our custom-built integral-field spectrograph, SAURON, operating on the William Herschel Telescope. Using high-quality spectra, spatially binned to a constant signal-to-noise ratio, we measure four key age, metallicity and abundance ratio sensitive indices from the Lick/IDS system over a two-dimensional field extending up to approximately one effective radius. A discussion of calibrations and offsets is given, along with a description of error estimation and nebular emission correction. We modify the classical Fe5270 index to define a new index, Fe5270S, which maximizes the useable spatial coverage of SAURON. Maps of H{\{}beta{\}}, Fe5015, Mg b and Fe5270S are presented for each galaxy. We use the maps to compute average line strengths integrated over circular apertures of one-eighth effective radius, and compare the resulting relations of index versus velocity dispersion with previous long-slit work. The metal line strength maps show generally negative gradients with increasing radius roughly consistent with the morphology of the light profiles. Remarkable deviations from this general trend exist, particularly the Mg b isoindex contours appear to be flatter than the isophotes of the surface brightness for about 40 per cent of our galaxies without significant dust features. Generally, these galaxies exhibit significant rotation. We infer from this that the fast-rotating component features a higher metallicity and/or an increased Mg/Fe ratio as compared to the galaxy as a whole. The H{\{}beta{\}} maps are typically flat or show a mild positive outwards radial gradient, while a few galaxies show strong central peaks and/or elevated overall H{\{}beta{\}} strength likely connected to recent star formation activity. For the most prominent post-starburst galaxies, even the metal line strength maps show a reversed gradient.},

abstract = {We present the emission-line fluxes and kinematics of 48 representative elliptical and lenticular galaxies obtained with our custom-built integral-field spectrograph, SAURON, operating on the William Herschel Telescope. H{\{}beta{\}}, [O III]{\{}lambda{\}}{\{}lambda{\}}4959,5007 and [N I]{\{}lambda{\}}{\{}lambda{\}}5198,5200 emission lines were measured using a new procedure that simultaneously fits both the stellar spectrum and the emission lines. Using this technique we can detect emission lines down to an equivalent width of 0.1 A set by the current limitations in describing galaxy spectra with synthetic and real stellar templates, rather than by the quality of our spectra. Gas velocities and velocity dispersions are typically accurate to within 14 and 20 km s-1, respectively, and at worse to within 25 and 40 km s-1. The errors on the flux of the [O III] and H{\{}beta{\}} lines are on average 10 and 20 per cent, respectively, and never exceed 30 per cent. Emission is clearly detected in 75 per cent of our sample galaxies, and comes in a variety of resolved spatial distributions and kinematic behaviours. A mild dependence on the Hubble type and galactic environment is observed, with higher detection rates in lenticular galaxies and field objects. More significant is the fact that only 55 per cent of the galaxies in the Virgo cluster exhibit clearly detected emission. The ionized-gas kinematics is rarely consistent with simple coplanar circular motions. However, the gas almost never displays completely irregular kinematics, generally showing coherent motions with smooth variations in angular momentum. In the majority of the cases, the gas kinematics is decoupled from the stellar kinematics, and in half of the objects this decoupling implies a recent acquisition of gaseous material. Over the entire sample however, the distribution of the mean misalignment values between stellar and gaseous angular momenta is inconsistent with a purely external origin. The distribution of kinematic misalignment values is found to be strongly dependent on the apparent flattening and the level of rotational support of galaxies, with flatter, fast rotating objects hosting preferentially corotating gaseous and stellar systems. In a third of the cases, the distribution and kinematics of the gas underscore the presence of non-axisymmetric perturbations of the gravitational potential. Consistent with previous studies, the presence of dust features is always accompanied by gas emission while the converse is not always true. A considerable range of values for the [O III]/H{\{}beta{\}} ratio is found both across the sample and within single galaxies. Despite the limitations of this ratio as an emission-line diagnostic, this finding suggests either that a variety of mechanisms is responsible for the gas excitation in E and S0 galaxies or that the metallicity of the interstellar material is quite heterogeneous.},

abstract = {We present observations of the stellar and gas kinematics for a representative sample of 24 Sa galaxies obtained with our custom-built integral-field spectrograph SAURON operating on the William Herschel Telescope. The data have been homogeneously reduced and analysed by means of a dedicated pipeline. All resulting data cubes were spatially binned to a minimum mean signal-to-noise ratio of 60 per spatial and spectral resolution element. Our maps typically cover the bulge-dominated region. We find a significant fraction of kinematically decoupled components (12/24), many of them displaying central velocity dispersion minima. They are mostly aligned and co-rotating with the main body of the galaxies, and are usually associated with dust discs and rings detected in unsharp-masked images. Almost all the galaxies in the sample (22/24) contain significant amounts of ionized gas which, in general, is accompanied by the presence of dust. The kinematics of the ionized gas are consistent with circular rotation in a disc co-rotating with respect to the stars. The distribution of mean misalignments between the stellar and gaseous angular momenta in the sample suggests that the gas has an internal origin. The [O III]/H{\{}beta{\}} ratio is usually very low, indicative of current star formation, and shows various morphologies (ring-like structures, alignments with dust lanes or amorphous shapes). The star formation rates (SFRs) in the sample are comparable with that of normal disc galaxies. Low gas velocity dispersion values appear to be linked to regions of intense star formation activity. We interpret this result as stars being formed from dynamically cold gas in those regions. In the case of NGC 5953, the data suggest that we are witnessing the formation of a kinematically decoupled component from cold gas being acquired during the ongoing interaction with NGC 5954.},

Galaxies in our sample probe the elliptical E, lenticular S0 and spiral Sa populations in the nearby Universe, both in field and cluster environments. We perform aperture photometry to derive homogeneous structural quantities. In combination with the SAURON stellar velocity dispersion measured within an effective radius ({\{}sigma{\}}e), this allows us to explore the location of our galaxies in the colour-magnitude, colour-{\{}sigma{\}}e, Kormendy, Faber-Jackson and Fundamental Plane scaling relations. We investigate the dependence of these relations on our recent kinematical classification of early-type galaxies (i.e. slow/fast rotators) and the stellar populations. Slow rotator and fast rotator E/S0 galaxies do not populate distinct locations in the scaling relations, although slow rotators display a smaller intrinsic scatter. We find that Sa galaxies deviate from the colour-magnitude and colour-{\{}sigma{\}}e relations due to the presence of dust, while the E/S0 galaxies define tight relations. Surprisingly, extremely young objects do not display the bluest (V-[3.6]) colours in our sample, as is usually the case in optical colours. This can be understood in the context of the large contribution of thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch stars to the infrared, even for young populations, resulting in a very tight (V-[3.6])-{\{}sigma{\}}e relation that in turn allows us to define a strong correlation between metallicity and {\{}sigma{\}}e. Many Sa galaxies appear to follow the Fundamental Plane defined by E/S0 galaxies. Galaxies that appear offset from the relations correspond mostly to objects with extremely young populations, with signs of ongoing, extended star formation. We correct for this effect in the Fundamental Plane, by replacing luminosity with stellar mass using an estimate of the stellar mass-to-light ratio, so that all galaxies are part of a tight, single relation. The new estimated coefficients are consistent in both photometric bands and suggest that differences in stellar populations account for about half of the observed tilt with respect to the virial prediction. After these corrections, the slow rotator family shows almost no intrinsic scatter around the best-fitting Fundamental Plane. The use of a velocity dispersion within a small aperture (e.g. Re/8) in the Fundamental Plane results in an increase of around 15 per cent in the intrinsic scatter and an average 10 per cent decrease in the tilt away from the virial relation.},

abstract = {Following our study on the incidence, morphology and kinematics of the ionized gas in early-type galaxies, we now address the question of what is powering the observed nebular emission. To constrain the likely sources of gas excitation, we resort to a variety of ancillary data we draw from complementary information on the gas kinematics, stellar populations and galactic potential from the SAURON data, and use the SAURON-specific diagnostic diagram juxtaposing the [O III]{\{}lambda{\}}5007/H{\{}beta{\}} and [N I]{\{}lambda{\}}{\{}lambda{\}}5197, 5200/H{\{}beta{\}} line ratios. We find a tight correlation between the stellar surface brightness and the flux of the H{\{}beta{\}} recombination line across our sample, which points to a diffuse and old stellar source as the main contributor of ionizing photons in early-type galaxies, with post-asymptotic giant branch (pAGB) stars being still the best candidate based on ionizing balance arguments. The role of AGN photoionization is confined to the central 2-3 arcsec of an handful of objects with radio or X-ray cores. OB-stars are the dominant source of photoionization in 10 per cent of the SAURON sample, whereas for another 10 per cent the intense and highly ionized emission is powered by the pAGB population associated to a recently formed stellar subcomponent. Fast shocks are not an important source of ionization for the diffuse nebular emission of early-type galaxies since the required shock velocities can hardly be attained in the potential of our sample galaxies. Finally, in the most massive and slowly or non-rotating galaxies in our sample, which can retain a massive X-ray halo, the finding of a spatial correlation between the hot and warm phases of the interstellar medium (ISM) suggests that the interaction with the hot ISM provides an additional source of ionization besides old ultraviolet-bright stars. This is also supported by a distinct pattern towards lower values of the [O III]/H{\{}beta{\}} ratio. These results lead us to investigate the relative role of stellar and AGN photoionization in explaining the ionized gas emission observed in early-type galaxies by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). By simulating how our sample galaxies would appear if placed at further distance and targeted by the SDSS, we conclude that only in very few, if any, of the SDSS galaxies which display modest values for the equivalent width of the [O III] line (less than [{\~{}}]2.4 A) and low-ionization nuclear emission-line region like [O III]/H{\{}beta{\}} values the nebular emission is truly powered by an AGN.},

abstract = {Winds blown from collapsar accretion 
disks may produce observable stellar explosions independent of any GRB‐(and afterglow)‐producing jets which may be simultaneously produced. The production of winds is controlled by the accretion 
disk physics, in particular, the nature of disk cooling via neutrino emission and photo‐disintegration of heavy nuclei. These temperature‐dependent processes depend on the stellar angular momentum via the depth of the gravitational potential at the Kepler radius where the disk forms. Wind‐driven stellar explosions which do not make a GRB (or only a faint one) may occur and constitute a new class of supernova 
explosion. SN1998bw and 1997ef may be examples. A key feature of collapsar winds is that they are capable of producing the radioactive 56
Ni necessary to power a supernova light curve. It is possible to make a GRB in a star without significant production of 56
Ni. Such a star would not make an observable supernova and no such component would be expected in the light curve of the optical afterglow.},

For single stars, stellar winds are the only means of mass loss, and these are a function of the metallicity of the star. We discuss how metallicity, and a simplified prescription for its effect on mass loss, affects the evolution and final fate of massive stars. We map, as a function of mass and metallicity, where black holes and neutron stars are likely to form and where different types of supernovae are produced. Integrating over an initial mass function, we derive the relative populations as a function of metallicity. Provided that single stars rotate rapidly enough at death, we speculate on stellar populations that might produce gamma-ray bursts and jet-driven supernovae.},

In a collapsing star, this black hole can form in two ways: the direct collapse of the stellar core into a black hole and the delayed collapse of a black hole caused by fallback in a weak supernova explosion. In the case of a delayed-collapse black hole, the strong collapsar-driven explosion overtakes the weak supernova explosion before shock breakout, and it is very difficult to distinguish this black hole formation scenario from the direct-collapse scenario. However, the delayed-collapse mechanism, with its double explosion, produces explosive nucleosynthetic yields that are very different from those in the direct-collapse scenario. We present one-dimensional studies of the nucleosynthetic yields from both black hole formation scenarios, deriving differences and trends in their nucleosynthetic yields.},

abstract = {GRB060505 and GRB060614 are nearby long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) without accompanying supernovae (SNe) down to very strict limits. They thereby challenge the conventional LGRB-SN connection and naturally give rise to the question: are there other peculiar features in their afterglows which would help shed light on their progenitors? To answer this question, we combine new observational data with published data and investigate the multi-band temporal and spectral properties of the two afterglows. We find that both afterglows can be well interpreted within the framework of the jetted standard external shock wave model, and that the afterglow parameters for both bursts fall well within the range observed for other LGRBs. Hence, from the properties of the afterglows there is nothing to suggest that these bursts should have another progenitor than other LGRBs. Recently, Swift-discovered GRB080503 also has the spike + tail structure during its prompt gamma-ray emission seemingly similar to GRB060614. We analyse the prompt emission of this burst and find that this GRB is actually a hard-spike + hard-tail burst with a spectral lag of 0.8{\$}\backslashpm{\$}0.4 s during its tail emission. Thus, the properties of the prompt emission of GRB060614 and GRB080503 are clearly different, motivating further thinking of GRB classification. Finally we note that, whereas the progenitor of the two SN-less bursts remains uncertain, the core-collapse origin for the SN-less bursts would be quite certain if a wind-like environment can be observationally established, e.g, from an optical decay faster than the X-ray decay in the afterglow's slow cooling phase.},

The spectral and temporal radio behavior indicate that the fireball has undergone a transition to subrelativistic expansion at t {\~{}} 100 days. This allows us to perform calorimetry of the explosion. The derived total energy, E0 {\~{}} 5 × 1050 ergs, is well below the {\~{}}5 × 1051 ergs inferred under the assumption of spherical symmetry from gamma-ray and early afterglow observations. A natural consequence of this result, which can also account for deviations at t {\textless} 100 days from the spherical relativistic fireball model predictions, is that the fireball was initially a wide-angle jet of opening angle {\~{}}30°. Our analysis also allows determination of the energy fractions carried by the electrons and magnetic field and the density of the ambient medium surrounding the fireball. We find that during the subrelativistic expansion, the electrons and magnetic field are close to equipartition and the density of the ambient medium is {\~{}}1 cm -3. The inferred density rules out the possibility that the fireball expands into a strongly nonuniform medium, as would be expected, e.g., in the case of a massive star progenitor.},

abstract = {We report the best evidence to date of a jet break in a short Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) afterglow, using Chandra and Swift XRT observations of the X-ray afterglow of GRB 051221A. The combined X-ray light curve, which has three breaks, is similar to those commonly observed in Swift observations of long GRBs. A flat segment of the light curve at {\~{}}0.1 days after the burst represents the first clear case of strong energy injection in the external shock of a short GRB afterglow. The last break occurs at {\~{}}4 days post-burst and breaks to a power-law decay index of {\~{}}2. We interpret this as a jet break, with important implications for models of short GRBs, since it requires collimation of the afterglow into a jet with an initial opening angle {\~{}}4-8 degrees and implies a total jet kinetic energy of E{\_}jet {\~{}}(1-5) x 10{\^{}}{\{}49{\}} erg. Combined with the lack of a jet break in GRB 050724, this suggests a wide range in jet collimation in short GRBs, with at least some having collimation similar to that found in long GRBs, though with significantly lower jet energies.},

abstract = {We present optical, near-infrared, and radio observations of the afterglow of GRB 120521C. By modeling the multi-wavelength data set, we derive a photometric redshift of z ≈ 6.0, which we confirm with a low signal-to-noise ratio spectrum of the afterglow. We find that a model with a constant-density environment provides a good fit to the afterglow data, with an inferred density of n ≲ 0.05 cm{\^{}}−3. The radio observations reveal the presence of a jet break at t{\_}jet ≈ 7 d, corresponding to a jet opening angle of $\theta${\_}jet ≈ 3°. The beaming-corrected $\gamma$-ray and kinetic energies are E{\_}$\gamma$ ≈ E{\_}K ≈ 3 × 10{\^{}}50 erg. We quantify the uncertainties in our results using a detailed Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis, which allows us to uncover degeneracies between the physical parameters of the explosion. To compare GRB 120521C to other high-redshift bursts in a uniform manner we re-fit all available afterglow data for the two other bursts at z gsim 6 with radio detections (GRBs 050904 and 090423). We find a jet break at t{\_}jet ≈ 15 d for GRB 090423, in contrast to previous work. Based on these three events, we find that $\gamma$-ray bursts (GRBs) at z ≳ 6 appear to explode in constant-density environments, and exhibit a wide range of energies and densities that span the range inferred for lower redshift bursts. On the other hand, we find a hint for narrower jets in the z ≳ 6 bursts, potentially indicating a larger true event rate at these redshifts. Overall, our results indicate that long GRBs share a common progenitor population at least to z {\~{}} 8.},

abstract = {Gamma-ray bursts are the most powerful explosions known in the Universe. Since their discovery in the early 1970s, they have been the subject of intense study but have defied detailed explanation. It is believed that supernovae and gamma-ray bursts may be related phenomena. This book brings together scientists working on supernovae and gamma-ray bursts to explore this connection and forge a new understanding. It includes invited reviews by leading experts in both fields who gathered at the Space Telescope Science Institute. It provides a comprehensive review of observations (ranging from gamma-rays to the radio) and theoretical models of supernovae and gamma-ray bursts, and a fascinating exploration of the possible links between the two classes of objects. It also critically examines the use of Type Ia supernovae for measuring the size of the Universe, and recent evidence for a cosmological constant. This volume provides a unique and stimulating reference for all students and researchers interested in supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, and the relationship between them.},

This phenomenology can either be due to an intrinsically short-lived engine or to different progenitor properties between relativistic SNe and GRBs.},

abstract = {The double explosion of SN 2009ip in 2012 raises questions about our understanding of the late stages of massive star evolution. Here we present a comprehensive study of SN 2009ip during its remarkable rebrightenings. High-cadence photometric and spectroscopic observations from the GeV to the radio band obtained from a variety of ground-based and space facilities (including the Very Large Array, Swift, Fermi, Hubble Space Telescope, and XMM) constrain SN 2009ip to be a low energy (E {\~{}} 1050 erg for an ejecta mass {\~{}}0.5 M ☉) and asymmetric explosion in a complex medium shaped by multiple eruptions of the restless progenitor star. Most of the energy is radiated as a result of the shock breaking out through a dense shell of material located at {\~{}}5 × 1014 cm with M {\~{}} 0.1 M ☉, ejected by the precursor outburst {\~{}}40 days before the major explosion. We interpret the NIR excess of emission as signature of material located further out, the origin of which has to be connected with documented mass-loss episodes in the previous years. Our modeling predicts bright neutrino emission associated with the shock break-out if the cosmic-ray energy is comparable to the radiated energy. We connect this phenomenology with the explosive ejection of the outer layers of the massive progenitor star, which later interacted with material deposited in the surroundings by previous eruptions. Future observations will reveal if the massive luminous progenitor star survived. Irrespective of whether the explosion was terminal, SN 2009ip brought to light the existence of new channels for sustained episodic mass loss, the physical origin of which has yet to be identified.},

abstract = {We systematically reanalyzed all gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglow data published through the end of 2002 in an attempt to detect the predicted supernova light component and to gain statistical insight into its phenomenological properties. We fit the observed photometric light curves as the sum of an afterglow, an underlying host galaxy, and a supernova component. The latter is modeled using published multicolor light curves of SN 1998bw as a template. The total sample of afterglows with established redshifts contains 21 bursts (GRB 970228-GRB 021211). For nine of these GRBs a weak supernova excess (scaled to SN 1998bw) was found, which is what makes this one of the first samples of high-z core-collapse supernovae. Among this sample are all bursts with redshifts less than {\~{}}0.7. These results strongly support the notion that in fact all afterglows of long-duration GRBs contain light from an associated supernova. A statistics of the physical parameters of these GRB-supernovae shows that SN 1998bw was at the bright end of its class, while it was not special with respect to its light-curve shape. Finally, we have searched for a potential correlation of the supernova luminosities with the properties of the corresponding bursts and optical afterglows, but we have not found such a relation.},

On occasion, this stellar collapse also powers an even more brilliant relativistic explosion known as a long-duration gamma-ray burst. One would then expect that these long gamma-ray bursts and core-collapse supernovae should be found in similar galactic environments. Here we show that this expectation is wrong. We find that the gamma-ray bursts are far more concentrated in the very brightest regions of their host galaxies than are the core-collapse supernovae. Furthermore, the host galaxies of the long gamma-ray bursts are significantly fainter and more irregular than the hosts of the core-collapse supernovae. Together these results suggest that long-duration gamma-ray bursts are associated with the most extremely massive stars and may be restricted to galaxies of limited chemical evolution. Our results directly imply that long gamma-ray bursts are relatively rare in galaxies such as our own Milky Way.},

Although all these events result from the death of massive stars, the electromagnetic luminosities of GRBs and XRFs exceed those of ordinary type Ibc supernovae by many orders of magnitude. The essential physical process that causes a dying star to produce a GRB or XRF, and not just a supernova, is still unknown. Here we report radio and X-ray observations of XRF 060218 (associated with supernova SN 2006aj), the second-nearest GRB identified until now. We show that this event is a hundred times less energetic but ten times more common than cosmological GRBs. Moreover, it is distinguished from ordinary type Ibc supernovae by the presence of 10(48) erg coupled to mildly relativistic ejecta, along with a central engine (an accretion-fed, rapidly rotating compact source) that produces X-rays for weeks after the explosion. This suggests that the production of relativistic ejecta is the key physical distinction between GRBs or XRFs and ordinary supernovae, while the nature of the central engine (black hole or magnetar) may distinguish typical bursts from low-luminosity, spherical events like XRF 060218.},

abstract = {Long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are associated with type Ic supernovae that are more luminous than average and that eject material at very high velocities. Less-luminous supernovae were not hitherto known to be associated with GRBs, and therefore GRB-supernovae were thought to be rare events. Whether X-ray flashes--analogues of GRBs, but with lower luminosities and fewer gamma-rays--can also be associated with supernovae, and whether they are intrinsically 'weak' events or typical GRBs viewed off the axis of the burst, is unclear. Here we report the optical discovery and follow-up observations of the type Ic supernova SN 2006aj associated with X-ray flash XRF 060218. Supernova 2006aj is intrinsically less luminous than the GRB-supernovae, but more luminous than many supernovae not accompanied by a GRB. The ejecta velocities derived from our spectra are intermediate between these two groups, which is consistent with the weakness of both the GRB output and the supernova radio flux. Our data, combined with radio and X-ray observations, suggest that XRF 060218 is an intrinsically weak and soft event, rather than a classical GRB observed off-axis. This extends the GRB-supernova connection to X-ray flashes and fainter supernovae, implying a common origin. Events such as XRF 060218 are probably more numerous than GRB-supernovae.},

This evidence was originally based on the probable association of one unusual GRB with a supernova, but now includes the association of GRBs with regions of massive star formation in distant galaxies, the appearance of supernova-like 'bumps' in the optical afterglow light curves of several bursts and lines of freshly synthesized elements in the spectra of a few X-ray afterglows. These observations support, but do not yet conclusively demonstrate, the idea that long-duration GRBs are associated with the deaths of massive stars, presumably arising from core collapse. Here we report evidence that a very energetic supernova (a hypernova) was temporally and spatially coincident with a GRB at redshift z = 0.1685. The timing of the supernova indicates that it exploded within a few days of the GRB, strongly suggesting that core-collapse events can give rise to GRBs, thereby favouring the 'collapsar' model.},

Here we report the discovery of transient optical emission in the error box of the -ray burst GRB980425, the light curve of which was very different from that of previous optical afterglows associated with -ray bursts. The optical transient is located in a spiral arm of the galaxy ESO184-G82, which has a redshift velocity of only 2,550 km s-1 (ref. 6). Its optical spectrum and location indicate that it is a very luminous supernova7, which has been identified as SN1998bw.

@article{Chevalier1998,
abstract = {The radio emission from supernovae has been modeled as synchrotron emission from the interaction between the supernova and a presupernova stellar wind. The emission shows a late power-law decline and early rise due to a low-frequency absorption process, which, in some cases (SN 1979C and SN 1980K), is well modeled as free-free absorption by the external wind. However, the flux rises in many radio supernovae (e.g., SN 1987A and Type Ib and Type Ic supernovae) have not been sufficiently well observed to define the absorption mechanism. The assumption of synchrotron self-absorption yields an approximate radius of the emission region at the time of peak flux. If another mechanism is dominant, the radius must be even larger. The large radii implied for SN 1987A and the observed Type Ib and Type Ic supernovae make external free-free absorption unlikely, given what else is known about these systems, so that synchrotron self-absorption is the probable absorption mechanism. Synchrotron self-absorption may play a role in the radio emission from SN 1981K (type unknown) and SN 1978K (Type IIn). Model supernova light curves with synchrotron self-absorption are presented. A combination of synchrotron self-absorption and external free-free absorption may be relevant to SN 1993J. The radii implied for the Type II supernovae SN 1979C and SN 1980K in the synchrotron self-absorption model are smaller than the radii expected for circumstellar interaction and are thus consistent with the free-free absorption mechanism.},

The outflowing material comprises an inner shell of shocked ejecta and an outer shell of shocked ambient gas. Similarity variables are developed for the inner region and boundary conditions are defined for numerical solution. The pressure is assumed to be continuous at the contact discontinuity between the two regions and self-similar solutions yield the thicknesses of the two shells. Applications are made to the cases of Type I and II supernovae, showing that thin shells form initially which are over 300 times the ambient density, but optical emissions occur only when lumps of material are present in the shocked gas before the shock arrives. The self-similar solutions are found to be accurate if the expanding matter has a power-law distribution.},

abstract = {Dwarf satellite galaxies are thought to be the remnants of the population of primordial structures that coalesced to form giant galaxies like the Milky Way. It has previously been suspected that dwarf galaxies may not be isotropically distributed around our Galaxy, because several are correlated with streams of H I emission, and may form coplanar groups. These suspicions are supported by recent analyses. It has been claimed that the apparently planar distribution of satellites is not predicted within standard cosmology, and cannot simply represent a memory of past coherent accretion. However, other studies dispute this conclusion. Here we report the existence of a planar subgroup of satellites in the Andromeda galaxy (M 31), comprising about half of the population. The structure is at least 400 kiloparsecs in diameter, but also extremely thin, with a perpendicular scatter of less than 14.1 kiloparsecs. Radial velocity measurements reveal that the satellites in this structure have the same sense of rotation about their host. This shows conclusively that substantial numbers of dwarf satellite galaxies share the same dynamical orbital properties and direction of angular momentum. Intriguingly, the plane we identify is approximately aligned with the pole of the Milky Way's disk and with the vector between the Milky Way and Andromeda.},

abstract = {According to the hierarchical clustering scenario, galaxies are assembled by merging and accretion of numerous satellites of different sizes and masses. This ongoing process is not 100{\%} efficient in destroying all of the accreted satellites, as evidenced by the satellites of our Galaxy and of M31. Using published data, we have compiled the circular velocity (Vcirc) distribution function (VDF) of galaxy satellites in the Local Group. We find that within the volumes of radius of 570 kpc (400 h-1 kpc assuming the Hubble constant h = 0.7) centered on the Milky Way and Andromeda, the average VDF is roughly approximated as n({\textgreater} Vcirc) ≈ 55 ± 11(Vcirc/10 km s-1)-1.4±0.4 h3 Mpc-3 for Vcirc in the range ≈10-70 km s-1. The observed VDF is compared with results of high-resolution cosmological simulations. We find that the VDF in models is very different from the observed one: n({\textgreater} Vcirc) ≈ 1200(Vcirc/10 km s-1)-2.75 h3 Mpc-3. Cosmological models thus predict that a halo the size of our Galaxy should have about 50 dark matter satellites with circular velocity greater than 20 km s-1 and mass greater than 3 × 108 M☉ within a 570 kpc radius. This number is significantly higher than the approximately dozen satellites actually observed around our Galaxy. The difference is even larger if we consider the abundance of satellites in simulated galaxy groups similar to the Local Group. The models predict {\~{}}300 satellites inside a 1.5 Mpc radius, while only {\~{}}40 satellites are observed in the Local Group. The observed and predicted VDFs cross at ≈50 km s-1, indicating that the predicted abundance of satellites with Vcirc  50 km s-1 is in reasonably good agreement with observations. We conclude, therefore, that unless a large fraction of the Local Group satellites has been missed in observations, there is a dramatic discrepancy between observations and hierarchical models, regardless of the model parameters. We discuss several possible explanations for this discrepancy including identification of some satellites with the high-velocity clouds observed in the Local Group and the existence of dark satellites that failed to accrete gas and form stars either because of the expulsion of gas in the supernovae-driven winds or because of gas heating by the intergalactic ionizing background.},

In particular, we discuss the possibility of a two phase cosmological evolution: a cold dark matter-like phase at the large scales/early times and a condensed phase inside dark matter halos. During the first phase dark matter is described by a minimally coupled weakly self-interacting scalar field, while in the second one dark matter condensates and, we shall argue, develops as a consequence the non-minimal coupling. Finally, we discuss how such non-minimal coupling could provide a new mechanism to address cold dark matter paradigm issues at galactic scales.},

abstract = {We present the HI data for 5 spiral galaxies that, along with their Halpha rotation curves, are used to derive the distribution of dark matter within these objects. A new method for extracting rotation curves from HI data cubes is presented; this takes into account the existence of a warp and minimises projection effects. The rotation curves obtained are tested by taking them as input to construct model data cubes that are compared to the observed ones: the agreement is excellent. On the contrary, the model data cubes built using rotation curves obtained with standard methods, such as the first-moment analysis, fail the test. The HI rotation curves agree well with the Halpha data, where they coexist. Moreover, the combined Halpha + HI rotation curves are smooth, symmetric and extended to large radii.   The rotation curves are decomposed into stellar, gaseous and dark matter contributions and the inferred density distribution is compared to various mass distributions: dark haloes with a central density core, {\$}\backslashLambda{\$} Cold Dark Matter ({\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM) haloes (NFW, Moore profiles), HI scaling and MOND. The observations point to haloes with constant density cores of size {\$}r{\_}{\{}core{\}} \backslashsim r{\_}{\{}opt{\}}{\$} and central densities scaling approximately as {\$}\backslashrho{\_}0 \backslashpropto r{\_}{\{}core{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-2/3{\}}{\$}. {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM models (which predict a central cusp in the density profile) are in clear conflict with the data.

abstract = {Two well studied dwarf galaxies -- NGC 3109 and NGC 6822 -- present some of the strongest observational support for a flat core at the center of galactic dark matter (DM) halos. We use detailed cosmologically motivated numerical models to investigate the systematics and the accuracy of recovering parameters of the galaxies. Some of our models match the observed structure of the two galaxies remarkably well. Our analysis shows that the rotation curves of these two galaxies are instead quite compatible with their DM halos having steep cuspy density profiles. The rotation curves in our models are measured using standard observational techniques. The models reproduce the rotation curves of both galaxies, the disk surface brightness profiles as well as the profile of isophotal ellipticity and position angle. The models are centrally dominated by baryons; however, the dark matter component is globally dominant. The simulated disk mass is marginally consistent with a stellar mass-to-light ratio in agreement with the observed colors. We show that non-circular motions combined with gas pressure support and projection effects results in a large underestimation of the circular velocity in the central {\$}\backslashsim 1{\$} kpc region, creating the illusion of a constant density core. Although the systematic effects mentioned above are stronger in barred systems, they are also present in axisymetric disks. Our results strongly suggest that there is no contradiction between the observed rotation curves in dwarf galaxies and the cuspy central dark matter density profiles predicted by Cold Dark Matter models.},

abstract = {Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are short, intense flashes of soft gamma-rays coming from the distant Universe. Long-duration GRBs (those lasting more than approximately 2 s) are believed to originate from the deaths of massive stars, mainly on the basis of a handful of solid associations between GRBs and supernovae. GRB 060614, one of the closest GRBs discovered, consisted of a 5-s hard spike followed by softer, brighter emission that lasted for approximately 100 s (refs 8, 9). Here we report deep optical observations of GRB 060614 showing no emerging supernova with absolute visual magnitude brighter than M(V) = -13.7. Any supernova associated with GRB 060614 was therefore at least 100 times fainter, at optical wavelengths, than the other supernovae associated with GRBs. This demonstrates that some long-lasting GRBs can either be associated with a very faint supernova or produced by different phenomena.},

@article{Fynbo2006,
abstract = {It is now accepted that long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are produced during the collapse of a massive star. The standard 'collapsar' model predicts that a broad-lined and luminous type Ic core-collapse supernova accompanies every long-duration GRB. This association has been confirmed in observations of several nearby GRBs. Here we report that GRB 060505 (ref. 10) and GRB 060614 (ref. 11) were not accompanied by supernova emission down to limits hundreds of times fainter than the archetypal supernova SN 1998bw that accompanied GRB 980425, and fainter than any type Ic supernova ever observed. Multi-band observations of the early afterglows, as well as spectroscopy of the host galaxies, exclude the possibility of significant dust obscuration and show that the bursts originated in actively star-forming regions. The absence of a supernova to such deep limits is qualitatively different from all previous nearby long-duration GRBs and suggests a new phenomenological type of massive stellar death.},

@article{Gehrels2006,
abstract = {Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are known to come in two duration classes, separated at approximately 2 s. Long-duration bursts originate from star-forming regions in galaxies, have accompanying supernovae when these are near enough to observe and are probably caused by massive-star collapsars. Recent observations show that short-duration bursts originate in regions within their host galaxies that have lower star-formation rates, consistent with binary neutron star or neutron star-black hole mergers. Moreover, although their hosts are predominantly nearby galaxies, no supernovae have been so far associated with short-duration GRBs. Here we report that the bright, nearby GRB 060614 does not fit into either class. Its approximately 102-s duration groups it with long-duration GRBs, while its temporal lag and peak luminosity fall entirely within the short-duration GRB subclass. Moreover, very deep optical observations exclude an accompanying supernova, similar to short-duration GRBs. This combination of a long-duration event without an accompanying supernova poses a challenge to both the collapsar and the merging-neutron-star interpretations and opens the door to a new GRB classification scheme that straddles both long- and short-duration bursts.},

This pedagogical review provides a detailed discussion of the major methods used to study galaxies morphologically and structurally, including the well-established visual method for morphology; S{\'{e}}rsic fitting to measure galaxy sizes and surface brightness profile shapes; and nonparametric structural methods [such as the concentration (C), asymmetry (A), clumpiness (S) (CAS) method and the Gini/M20 parameters, as well as newer structural indices].

abstract = {We investigate the high-frequency radio spectra of 20 low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs) with compact radio cores. Our millimetre survey with the Nobeyama Millimetre Array (NMA) and analyses of submillimetre archival data that had been obtained with the Submillimetre Common User Bolometer Array (SCUBA) on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) reveal the following properties. At least half of the LLAGNs show inverted spectra between 15 and 96 GHz; we use the published data at 15 GHz with the Very Large Array (VLA) in a 0.15-arcsec resolution and our measurements at 96 GHz with the NMA in a 7-arcsec resolution. The inverted spectra are not artificially made due to their unmatched beam sizes, because of little diffuse contamination from dust, H II regions, or extended jets in these LLAGNs. Such high-frequency inverted spectra are apparently consistent with a ‘submillimetre bump', which is predicted by an advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) model. We find a strong correlation between the high-frequency spectral index and low-frequency core power measured with very-long-baseline-interferometry (VLBI) instruments. The inverted spectra are found exclusively in low-core-power sources, while steep spectra are in high-core-power ones with prominent pc-scale jets. This suggests that the ADAF and non-thermal jets may coexist. The flux ratios between disc and jet seem to be different from LLAGN to LLAGN; disc components can be seen in nuclear radio spectra only if the jets are faint.},
